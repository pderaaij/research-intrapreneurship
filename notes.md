# Notes & Questions

- [ ] Psychological contract a form of needs-supplies fit?
- [ ] Getting clear what difference score means
  - Presumably it's about the algebraic difference between A and B

| Fit is equal     | Excess fit                                                                                                                            | Deficient fit                                                         |
| Needs = Supplied | Needs < Supplied                                                                                                                      | Needs > Supplied                                                      |
| Will lead to IB  | Following Yu will lead to higher levels of proactivity. Vitamin model study shows that excess autonomy had little impact on wellbeing | Higher levels of proactivity, but less then excess supply of autonomy |

In short: general Pe-fit theory suggests that there is an u-shaped curve regarding fit and mistfit. Excess misfit will lead to decrease in output. However, studies shows that an excess of autonomy misfit does not yield any decrease in output and might even yield to higher output on certain behaviours. The breach and fullfilment study shows the misfit effect might differ per discriminant. As such it is valuable to research the impact of autonomy misfit directly on IB.

Why autonomy misift yields to even better output results? Study of Yu....
