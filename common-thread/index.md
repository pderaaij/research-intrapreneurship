An answer to the question:

> How does autonomy misfit, together with psychological safety in a team, contribute to intrapreneurial behaviour?

## Chapter 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background & Context

- Organisations need to remain and gain competitive advantage to stay ahead of their competition
- Already in 1986 @tushman1986 stressed that “organisations can gain competitive advantage only by managing effectively for today while simultaneously creating innovation for tomorrow” and suggested that “there is perhaps no more pressing managerial problem that the sustained management of innovation” [@urbancova2013].
- It requires all employees to be innovative and contribute to the ever changing goals of the organisation
- Intrapreneurs are more and more deemed as an important factor to innovation and economic growth and thus organization's competitive advantages [@elert2020; @gawke2019]
- It changes the expectations from organisations of their employees
- “Rather than being passive recipients of changing jobs and products, employees need to adopt roles as “innovators” and “differentiators” [@bowen2016].
- “More specifically, employees are increasingly required to adopt a more intrapreneurial way of working to deal with or even initiate these changing requirements and directly impact a firm’s strategic direction [@peters1982].
- Organisations are looking to increase intrapreneurship
- Intrapreneurship, also known as corporate entrepreneurship, is a process of recognising and exploiting opportunities by being innovative, proactive and taking risks [@neessen2019; @gawke2019; @deJong2015]
- These three latter dimensions are behavioural dimensions of intrapreneurship that have attitudes and characteristics as their antecedents [@neessen2019; @deJong2015]
- Three approaches to intrapreneurship [@gawke2019].
  - Entrepreneurial orientation
  - Intrapreneurial outcomes approach
  - Behaviour-based approach
- The behaviours of innovativeness, proactivity, and risk taking matches the entrepreneurial orientation as described by [@gawke2019]

### 1.2 Problem statement

- Not all employees will behave as intrapreneurs.
  @neessen2019 stated that "giving employees autonomy in their work is one of the other dimensions that influence the intrapreneur.".
- Possible explanation why some people will act as intrapreneurs and others don't can be examined through the perspective of Person-Environment fit.
- "The P-E fit approach suggests that individual attitudes, behaviours, and other outcomes result not from the person or environment separately, but rather from the relationship between the two (Edwards, 1996), emphasising the importance of compatibility between workers and the work environment (Kristof, 1996) in worker well-being and performance [@jong2021]"
- Many relations between person and environment has been researched, and the same goes for consequences and outputs of P-E (mis)fit. [@kristof2005; @yu2016; @pee2017]
- Job autonomy has been researched in various ways [@yu2016; @sorlie2022; @simmering2003; @jong2021], but not in relation with innovation or intrapreneurship.
- This research aims to bring new perspectives on the needs-supplies misfit between person and organisation regarding the levels of autonomy, and it's impact on intrapreneurial behaviour
- Innovation and process improvements have been found at teams that have high levels of psychological safety [@edmondson1999; @edmondsonLei2014; @newman2017].
- Psychological safety is a shared belief held by members of a team that the team is safe for interpersonal risk taking [@edmondson1999].
- If a team feels safe, they will share more information and as such learn more then teams with lower levels of psychological safety [@edmondson1999; @newman2017].

### 1.3 Relevance for practice and academics

- Not much is known about the relation of psychological safety and intrapreneurial behaviour and between autonomy (mis)fit and intrapreneurial behaviour, the contribution of this research is to fill in these gaps.

- **Practice**
  - Organisations benefit from innovation and other means of gaining competitive advantage [@elert2020]
  - The whole organisations needs to be intrapreneurs, but gaining more intrapreneurs is a hard path.
  - It will provide tangible advice whether or not psychological safety and/or autonomy misfit is beneficial towards intrapreneurial behaviour.
  - Organisations looking for intreprenereurial behaviour might want to adopt their recruitment strategy by selecting adaptable minds that can cope with misfit between levels of needs and supplies of autonomy [@yu2016; @vanVianen2018]
- **Academics**
  - Not much is known on the relationship between autonomy misfit, psychological safety and intrapreneurial behaviour
  - @vanVianen2018 raised the question "Which environmental and individual factors mitigate experienced misfits?". This research aims to shed a light on the question if psychological safety moderates an experienced misfit of autonomy

## Chapter 2. Literature

### 2.1 What is intrapreneurship

**Description**:

- Intrapreneurship, also known as corporate entrepreneurship, is a process:
  - > “Intrapreneurship is a process whereby employee(s) recognize and exploit opportunities by being innovative, proactive and by taking risks, in order for the organization to create new products, processes and services, initiate selfrenewal or venture new businesses to enhance the competitiveness and performance of the organization.” [@neessen2019, p. 7].
- As such intrapreneurship has to be seen as a process and not an attitude.
- The rationale behind this is that intrapreneurship is not merely a behavior of an individual or an organization, but is about a set of activities of an individual or an organization to get from point A to point B in time, with an increased competitiveness and performance of the organization as the end goal.” [@neessen2019, p. 8]

### 2.2 Introducing intrapreneurial behaviour & person-environment fit

**Description**:

- Intrapreneurship is defined in two big themes by @neessen2019: outcomes and behaviour.
- These behaviours are commonly defined as: proactive, innovativeness, risk taking [@neessen2019; @deJong2015; @gawke2019]
  - > “Articles that investigated the behavior of the intrapreneur mostly concentrated on these dimensions: innovativeness/creativeness, proactiveness, opportunity recognition and exploitation, risk-taking and networking.” [@neessen2019, p. 8]
- This follows an entrepreneurial orientation mentioned by @gawke2019
- Whether or not an employee will engage in intrapreneurial behaviour will be decided by a diverse set of factors. @neessen2019 in their review on intrapreneurship developed a nomological framework that displayed organisational factors, and attitudes and characteristics of intrapreneurs.
- Predicting if an individual will engage in certain human behaviour is a core tenet of the person-environment fit theory [@vanVianen2018]. The combination of person and environment will lead to a better prediction then the two factors separately.
- > "The P-E fit approach suggests that individual attitudes, behaviours, and other outcomes result not from the person or environment separately, but rather from the relationship between the two (Edwards, 1996) [@jong2021]".
- In the world of P-E fit a wide-range of fit concepts exists [@vanVianen2018]
- A needs-supplies fit displays the alignment of the employees needs, desires, or preferences and the supply provided by the job the perform [@kristof2005]
- The needs-supplies will help us in determining if the NS fit or misfit on the organisational factor of autonomy [@neessen2019] will influence intrapreneurial behaviour.

### 2.3 Autonomy misfit

- Generally a fit between person and their environment is desired to reach the optimal outcome, however the field of P-E fit argues for a nuanced perspective.
- @vanVianen2018 displayed in her in review study that experiencing misfit will lead to adaptation. Depending on the misfit perception, opportunities to repair the misfit, and environmental and individual mitigating factors it might motivate individuals to leave the job or to adapt to the situation.
- For example @yu2016 discovered that the mismatch between the levels of autonomy desired by an employee and the autonomy provided has been found to lead to higher levels of proactive behaviour at newcomers
- > This finding originates from the self-regulatory view that argues that newcomer behaviours are highest when there is a misfit between the organisational supply of autonomy and the needs of the individual [@yu2016].
- On that same note @simmering2003 found that autonomy misfit for an individual leads to higher engagement in employee development. Surprisingly this holds true for individuals with low levels of autonomy, but high levels of autonomy as well [@simmering2003].
- Although the research of @yu2016 and @simmering2003 are primarily focused on newcomers, @simmering2003 suggests that established employees could use the same strategies as newcomers to improve their fit levels.

- @neessen2019 determined autonomy as an important organisational factor contributing to intrapreneurial behaviour. @jong2021 argues that it is critical not to only examine the job autonomy on its own, but to examine the congruence between autonomy and preference for autonomy.
- Examining the needs-supplies fit of autonomy as such will provide a clearer picture on the effect of autonomy as contributing factor to intrapreneurial behaviour

- As such I hypothesise that a misfit of the needs-supplies regarding autonomy will positively influence intrapreneurial behaviour.

> Hypothesis 1: Autonomy misfit is positively related to intrapreneurial behaviour

### 2.4 Psychological safety

- The business environment of today accomplishes much work in collaboration [@edmondsonLei2014; @newman2017; @frazier2017]
- Organisational research has identified psychological safety as an important factor in understanding how people collaborate [@edmondsonLei2014]
- @frazier2017 recognises that psychological safety is a key factor in facilitating the process of learning, collaborating, and employee enagement
- Psychological safety is the shared belief by members of the team that the team is safe for interpersonal risk-0taking [@edmondson1999; @edmondsonLei2014; @frazier2017; @newman2017]
- High levels of psychological safety has been linked to higher levels of creative thinking and risk-taking, innovation in R&D teams, process improvements in manufacturing, knowledge creation, and successful implementation of technology [@newman2017]

**Relevance to intrapreneurial behaviour**:

- Higher levels of psychological safety enhances risk-taking, information sharing and learning behaviour of members from the team [@edmondson1999; @newman2017]
- Risk-taking is an intrapreneurial behaviour in the nomological network of @neessen2019
- The outcomes and characteristics of psychological safety can be expected to have a relation with each other, as such I hypothesise:

> Hypothesis 2: Psychological safety is positively related to intrapreneurial behaviour

- Given that higher levels of proactiveness is present in case of a misfit on autonomy level, I hypothesise that higher levels of proactiveness, reached due to psychological safety will positively influence the intrapreneurial behaviour

### 2.5 Autonomy misfit, proactive behaviour & psychological safety

- @yu2016 & @simmering2003 identified that an autonomy misfit leads to higher levels of proactive behaviour.
- @ashford1996 identified seven key types of change-oriented proactive behaviours:
  - feedback seeking; information seeking; job change negotiation; positive framing; general socialising; building relationships with the boss; and networking
- From these behaviours information seeking and feedback seeking have been found to be moderated by psychological safety
- @destobbeleir2020 showed that higher levels of psychological safety increases the amount of feedback seeking
- feedback seeking may be beneficial for individuals to cope with the misfit of autonomy [@vanVianen2018]
- High levels of psychological safety has shown that information will be sought within the team, where lower levels of psychological safety will lead to information seeking outside the team [@safdar2017]
- These forms of proactive behaviours all embed a form of risk-taking. It requires confidence and trust to engage in voice behaviour and start to ask for feedback and information.
- As higher levels of psychological safety reduces the barrier to engage in proactive behaviours I hypothesise that the level of psychological safety will influence the effect of autonomy misfit towards intrapreneurial behaviour
- Meaning that high levels of autonomy misfit and high levels of psychological safety will lead to higher levels of psychological safety.

> Hypothesis 3: Psychological safety moderates the positive effect of autonomy misfit towards intrapreneurial behaviour
