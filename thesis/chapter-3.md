# 3. Methodology

## 3.1 Research design

A descriptive research design is being used for this study. Collecting the data will be done utilising diary studies. Two primary reasons lead to the practice of using diary studies. First of all, diary studies are helpful to collect data on working environment characteristics that are subject to fluctuations [@bakker2014]. Secondly, using diary studies help to prevent common rater bias, a pronounced effect in PE-fit studies [@kristof2005]. Common rater bias are conscious or unconscious tendencies that affect supplied ratings. By using a diary study, and thus collecting responses on multiple days, this bias can be prevented. The developed hypothesis are concerned about the relationships of fluctuating states and are typical research questions to be answered by a diary study [@ohly2010].

As psychological safety is primarily a team construct [@edmondson1999] and getting to intrapreneurial outcomes is a team effort, the research design is focused on team behaviour as well. Teams are asked to collect data during a sprint. Sprints are a fixed period of time in which a teams tries to fulfil their commitments to work items, promised at the start of the sprint. The concept of sprints are part of Scrum, an agile methodology of work. Typically, sprints last for two weeks. When a sprint starts for the team, the data collection period starts as well.

From the start of the sprint team members will be asked to answer a daily questionnaire. Using daily diaries might increase retrospective bias compared to using experience-sampling methods [@ohly2010]. For this research, using experience-sampling is not required as we are not searching for affective or cognitive observations for specific events during the day. Rather, the research aims to get an overall perceived assessment of the day. Using daily diaries as such suffices and enables the participants to enter the survey at their own convenience, positively adding to the response rate. To further reduce nonresponse and dropout, as diary studies can be burdensome for the participants [@ohly2010], the number of daily questionnaires will be capped to 10, as done by other research [see @vleugels2018]. The daily assessments will be capped to a maximum of 5-7 minutes to not affect the willingness of participants as suggested by @ohly2010.

At the end of the sprint a closing survey will be sent to the members of the team and the team's supervisor. The closing survey of the team is an extended version compared to the daily surveys. The survey for the team supervisor is focused on assessing the perceived intrapreneurial behaviour of team. The supervisors answers ensure triangulation of the perceived data of the time, as such increasing the validity of the findings and preventing common rater bias [@kristof2005].

Teams are recruited via the network of the researcher via direct requests, public LinkedIn messages, and internal messages at the communication channels of the employer of the researcher. 72 organisations are contacted, of which 14 (19%) agreed to participate with a single team or more.

## 3.2 Data collection

### 3.2.1 Sample frame

@@ The collected data for this research will be gathered with teams active in software development. Software development teams commonly work according agile methodologies like Scrum or Kanban. Key philosophy in the Scrum Guide is becoming more proficient, as team, in the leading values of Scrum, namely: commitment; focus; openness; respect; and courage, in order to be successful [@scrumGuide]. The primary focus of the team is to make the best possible progress towards the goals that are set by the team. Given the Scrum values and its goal for the Scrum team, researching these hypothesis in software development teams is expected to yield interesting results. Companies using Scrum are likely to expect innovative behaviour of their teams as adaptation and self-management is an essential pillar of Scrum [@scrumGuide]. Additionally, Scrum teams are typically together for a longer period of time. This prevents diluting effects of socialisation behaviour typically seen at newcomers in an organisation [@yu2016; @vleugels2022].

To narrow the diversity of organisations participating in the research, participating teams are required to work in a commercial, for-profit organisation. At least 30 teams will participate in the research. Given the often multi-national composition of teams the survey will be held in English to enhance the possibility of participation.

### 3.2.2 Collection procedure

The collection for this research is separated in three phases ([@tbl:collection-approach]). The study recognises two types of respondents, team members and supervisors. Team members are those actively participating in the teams development efforts. This could be software developers, engineers, or UX designers. Supervisors are people overseeing or steering the activities of the team, for example Team Leads of Product Owners. The collection period was chosen by the team itself in correspondence with the researcher.

| Phase   | Survey              | Who                        | When                                  |
| ------- | ------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| T0      | Introduction survey | Team members               | Week before start of the sprint       |
| Dailies | Daily survey        | Team members               | Each day at 15:30                     |
| T1      | Final survey        | Team members & supervisors | Next working day after the last daily |

: Phased approach of data collection {#tbl:collection-approach}

All surveys were sent digitally via e-mail. The digital surveys were programmed in the software Qualtrics. The T0 survey was sent a week for the start of the sprint and had to be filled in before the first daily.All dailies were sent at 15:30 and only active for the day they have been sent out. Participants were free to ignore a survey due to a day off or work for another team. Lastly a T1 survey was sent directly after the dailies phase. For both the T0 and T1 a reminder has been send on the third day (@@ check if correct). Participants had the option to opt-out on any e-mail send to them, effectively stopping their participation in the survey.

During a period of data collection surveys will be distributed by e-mail for 10 consecutive working days at 15:30. This daily survey will hold questions for all variables that are being researched. All members of the team will receive this e-mail notification, expect for the team supervisor. The supervisor receives a notification on the 10th day of the collection period. The focus of this survey is to answer questions with regards to the perceived intrapreneurial behaviour of the entire team. These surveys will be programmed, collected, and distributed by using the software Qualtrics.

## 3.3 Measures

### 3.3.1 Intrapreneurial behaviour

Intrapreneurial behaviour is measured using the validated measurement of [@deJong2015]. This measurement is proven to measure the dimensions of proactive, innovativeness and risk-taking. This measurement is used in both the daily as the T1 survey. The construct in the T1 survey, both team member and supervisor, exists out of nine questions which are answered using a 7-point Likert scale (1= not at all, 7 = at all). An example question of the construct is: "I generate creative ideas", all questions can be read in appendix A. For the daily a shorter three item construct [@deJong2015] is used.

The daily construct has an $\alpha$ of .65. Typically a score higher then .7 is deemed acceptable (@@ nunnely?). Removing any items would not increase the reliability and removes the measurement of the variables proactive, innovativeness, and risk-taking. In the T1 survey the nine-item construct has an $\alpha$ of .97 for the team members. In the supervisor survey the construct scored an $\alpha$ of .98.

### 3.3.2 Autonomy (mis)fit

To determine the (mis)fit of autonomy for an individual the construct of [@spreitzer1995] is used. The construct is used in T0 and the daily surveys. In order to determine both the need and the supply, the same three items are asked with a different prefix. For the need, each item in the daily survey started with: "Today, I found...". "Today, I had..." was the prefix for the supply construct in the daily survey. The T0 survey had "I have/can..." as prefix for the supply, and "I find..." as prefix for the need.

This validated measurement consists out of three questions, all answered via a 7-point Likert scale (1= not at all, 7 = at all). "The opportunity to determine how I do my job" is an example question, all other questions can be read in appendix A. The alpha's for the various surveys are reported in [@tbl:alphas-autfit]

| Survey | Need or Supply | $\alpha$ |
| ------ | -------------- | -------- |
| T0     | Need           | .93      |
| T0     | Supply         | .94      |
| T1     | Need           | .92      |
| T1     | Supply         | .89      |

: Alpha's for autonomy needs and supplies construct in T0 and daily surveys {#tbl:alphas-autfit}

### 3.3.3 Psychological safety

Psychological safety is measured via the well-proven construct of @edmondson1999. As part of the T0 survey, a 7-point Likert scale (1= very inaccurate, 7 = very accurate) required the participants to answer 7 questions. Example questions are "Members of this team are able to bring up problems and tough issues" and "Working with members of this team, my unique skills and talents are value and utilised". The full list of questions is available in appendix A.

The construct of psychological safety has an $\alpha$ of .67, which is doubtful. Removing an item would not yield an higher reliability score.

### 3.3.4 Control variables

@@ dependent on answer Jana

Research of @mahmoud2020 shows a relation between an individual's personality and intrapreneurial behaviour. In its study the Big 5 traits conscientiousness, disagreeableness and neuroticism are related to intrapreneurial behaviour of individuals. The two remaining traits, extraversion and openness to experience did not revealed any significant impact. Nevertheless, the personality of an individual has an effect towards its attitude towards intrapreneurial behaviour. To test our hypothesis and prevent confounding results the personality scale of [@rammstedt2007] is added to the survey to control for personality.

Additionally the tenure of the team member at the organisation will be used as control in the analysis. As newcomers to an organisation tend to display socialisation behaviour [@yu2016], and as such additional proactivity, the tenure is used to correct for this period of time.

## 3.4 Data analysis

The analysis of data is done via the program 'RStudio' and the R packages 'lavaan' and 'multcomp'. Lavaan enables latent variable modelling and provides a large variety of multivariate statistical models. Multcomp offers tests and confidence intervals for general linear hypothesis.

The reliability of the constructs in the survey is tested by calculating Cronbach's alpha ($\alpha$). The internal consistency is deemed valid enough at a score of .7 or higher.

The analysis of relations and effect between the variables is done by polynomial regression equations [@edwards1994]. Polynomial regression analysis allows researchers to the effects of two predictor variables in relationship with an outcome [@shanock2010]. As an analytical technique it is often used to study person-environment fit (e.g. @edwards2009, @kristof2005, @yu2016). Predominantly interesting is that polynomial regression equations allow for three-dimensional investigations of the effect of autonomy needs and supply on intrapreneurial behaviour. Polynomial regression analyses are generally performed using the equation [-@eq:unmoderated_poly], where N = individual autonomy needs and S = organisational autonomy supplied.

$$
Z = b_0 + b_1N + b_2S + b_3N^2 + b_4NxS + b_5S^2
$$ {#eq:unmoderated_poly}


For this research the emphasis is not only on the interaction between needs and supplies on intrapreneurial behaviour, but also to assess a potential moderating effect of psychological safety. To test this effect, psychological safety needs to be added to the main model and interaction. This is done by multiplying each factor in our model, as done priorly by @vogel2016. The equation including moderating is shown in equation [-@eq:moderated_poly], where PS being psychological safety.


$$

Z = b_0 + b_1N + b_2S + b_3N^2 + b_4NxS + b_5S^2 + b_6PS + b_7PSxN + b_8PSxS + b_9PSxN^2 + b_10PSxNxS + b_11PSxS^2

$$
{#eq:moderated_poly}

@@ The results of the polynomial regression analysis are plotted in a three-dimensional space following @edwards1993. The three dimensional view allows for more explanatory potential than traditional moderated regression analyses [@shanock2010]. It visualises the relationship of two predictor variables on the outcome variable along the line of congruence and incongruence. The resulting surfaces are helpful in the explanation and understanding of the discovered findings.


### 3.4.1 Dataset preparation

In preparation of the analysis all data is exported from Qualtrics into Google Sheets. Relevant data is merged into a single worksheet in a short row format. The daily surveys acted as the base for the worksheet. Each daily was a single row with extra data like psychological safety from the T0 survey added as additional columns. Resulting into a workable dataset for polynomial regression analysis in RStudio. Partial surveys are deleted from the dataset. For the dailies 8 unfinished surveys were deleted, resulting into 336 useful datapoints.

A total of 24 teams participated in the daily studies. The number of unique participants is 79 of which 57% filled in the daily survey at least 4 times or more. Only 2 participants (2.53%) filled in all 10 surveys. For this study a 135 participants were registered to participate. With 79 unique persons responding, the response rate is 59%.

Not all respondents of the daily survey has filled in the T0 survey. 19 participants did not fill in the T0 survey, resulting into missing information on psychological safety. As RStudio can cope with partial information, and the data is still useful for hypothesis 1 and hypothesis 2 the daily surveys of these 19 people have not been removed for analysis. The T0 is opened by 73 respondents of which only 59 completed the survey (81%).

## 3.5 Methodological issues

Conducting research can lead to various methodological issues that potentially harm the reliability of the research. In order to prevent the occurrence of this research a number of preventive actions will be executed.

**Non-response**
In order to prevent non-response the recommendations of @ohly2010 have been incorporated in its research design. Setting a maximum of surveys and reducing the effort to complete them attributes to not burden the participants during the process. Starting from the fourth distribution group a personal introduction e-mail is sent to the participants. The e-mail outlined the goals of the survey and allowed for easier communication with the researcher in case of questions.
