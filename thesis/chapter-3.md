# 3. Methodology

## 3.1 Research design

A descriptive research design is being used for this study. Collecting the data was done utilising diary studies. Two primary reasons led to the practice of using diary studies. First of all, diary studies are helpful to collect data on working environment characteristics that are subject to fluctuations [@bakker2014]. Secondly, using diary studies help to prevent common rater bias, a pronounced effect in PE-fit studies [@kristof2005]. Common rater bias are conscious or unconscious tendencies that affect supplied ratings. By using a diary study, and thus collecting responses on multiple days this bias can be prevented. The developed hypothesis are concerned about the relationships of fluctuating states and are typical research questions to be answered by a diary study [@ohly2010].

As psychological safety is primarily a team construct [@edmondson1999] and getting to intrapreneurial outcomes is a team effort, the research design is focused on team behaviour as well. Teams are asked to collect data during a sprint. Sprints are a fixed period of time in which a teams tries to fulfil their commitments to work items, promised at the start of the sprint. The concept of sprints are part of Scrum, an agile methodology of work. Typically, sprints last for two weeks. When a sprint starts for the team, the data collection period starts as well.

From the start of the sprint team members are asked to answer a daily questionnaire. Using daily diaries might increase retrospective bias compared to using experience-sampling methods [@ohly2010]. For this research, using experience-sampling is not required as we are not searching for affective or cognitive observations for specific events during the day. Rather, the research aims to get an overall perceived assessment of the day. Using daily diaries as such suffices and enables the participants to enter the survey at their own convenience, positively adding to the response rate. To further reduce nonresponse and dropout, as diary studies can be burdensome for the participants [@ohly2010], the number of questionnaires is capped to 10, as done by other research [see @vleugels2018]. The daily assessments are capped to a maximum of 5-7 minutes to not affect the willingness of participants as suggested by @ohly2010.

At the end of the sprint a closing survey is sent to the members of the team and the team's supervisor. The closing survey of the team was an extended version compared to the daily surveys. The survey for the team supervisor is focused on assessing the perceived intrapreneurial behaviour of team. The supervisors answers ensure triangulation of the perceived data of the time, as such increasing the validity of the findings and preventing common rater bias [@kristof2005].

## 3.2 Data collection

The collected for this research is gathered with teams active in software development team. Software development teams commonly work according the Scrum methodology. Key philosophy in the Scrum Guide is becoming more proficient, as team, in the leading values of Scrum, namely: commitment; focus; openness; respect; and courage, in order to be successful [@scrumGuide]. The primary focus of the team is to make the best possible progress towards the goals that are set by the team. Given the Scrum values and its goal for the Scrum team, researching these hypothesis in software development teams is expected to yield interesting results. Companies using Scrum are likely to expect innovative behaviour of their teams as adaptation and self-management is an essential pillar of Scrum [@scrumGuide]. Additionally, Scrum teams are typically together for a longer period of time. This prevents diluting effects of socialisation behaviour typically seen at newcomers in an organisation [@yu2016; @vleugels2022].

To narrow the diversity of organisations participating in the research, participating teams are required to work in a commercial, for-profit organisation. At least 30 teams will participate in the research. Given the often multi-national composition of teams the survey will be held in English to enhance the possibility of participation.

During a period of data collection surveys were distributed by e-mail for 10 consecutive working days at 15:30. This daily survey held questions for all variables that are being researched. All members of the team received this e-mail notification, expect for the team supervisor. The supervisor received a notification on the 10th day of the collection period. The focus of this survey was to answer questions with regards to the perceived intrapreneurial behaviour of the entire team. These surveys were programmed, collected, and distributed by using the software Qualtrics.

## 3.3 Measures

### 3.3.1 Intrapreneurial behaviour

Intrapreneurial behaviour is measured using the validated measurement of [@deJong2015]. This measurement is proven to measure the dimensions of proactive, innovativeness and risk-taking. The construct exists out of nine questions which are answered using a 7-point Likert scale (1= not at all, 7 = at all). An example question of the construct is: "I generate creative ideas", all questions can be read in appendix A1.

### 3.3.2 Autonomy (mis)fit

To determine the (mis)fit of autonomy for an individual the construct of [@spreitzer1995] is used. This validated measurement consists out of three question, all answered via a 7-point Likert scale (1= not at all, 7 = at all). "The opportunity to determine how I do my job" is an example question, all other questions can be read in appendix A2.

### 3.3.3 Psychological safety

Psychological safety is measured via the well-proven construct of @edmondson1999. Using a 7-point Likert scale (1= very inaccurate, 7 = very accurate) the participants need to answer 7 questions. Example questions are "Members of this team are able to bring up problems and tough issues" and "Working with members of this team, my unique skills and talents are value and utilised". The full list of questions is available in appendix A3.

## 3.4 Data analysis

The analysis of data will be done via the program RStudio. Analysing and discovering relations and effects between the variables will be done utilising multiple regression analysis.

## 3.5 Methodological issues

Conducting research can lead to various methodological issues that potentially harm the reliability of the research. In order to prevent the occurrence of this research a number of preventive actions have been executed.

In order to prevent non-response the recommendations of @ohly2010 have been incorporated. Setting a maximum of surveys and reducing the effort to complete them attributes to not burden the participants during the process.
