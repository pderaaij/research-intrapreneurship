# 3. Methodology

## 3.1 Research design

Data was collected via diary studies. Diary studies are used for two primary reasons. First, diary studies are helpful for collecting data on working-environment characteristics that are subject to fluctuations [@bakker2014]. Second, using diary studies helps prevent common rater bias, a pronounced effect in PE-fit studies [@kristof2005]. Common rater biases are conscious or unconscious tendencies that influence supplied ratings. By using a diary study and thus by collecting responses on multiple days, this bias can be prevented. The developed hypotheses concern the relationships of fluctuating states and are typical research questions answered by a diary study [@ohly2010].

As psychological safety is primarily a team construct [@edmondson1999] and achieving intrapreneurial outcomes is a team effort, the research design is also focused on teams. Teams were asked to collect data during a sprint. Sprints are a fixed period in which a team tries to fulfil their commitments to work items, promised at the start of the sprint. The concept of a sprint is part of Scrum, an agile methodology of work. Typically, sprints lasted for two weeks. When a sprint started for a team, the data collection period started as well.

As soon as a sprint started, team members were asked to answer a daily questionnaire. Using daily diaries might increase retrospective bias compared to using experience-sampling methods [@ohly2010]. For this research, using experience sampling was not necessary, as the main concern was not the affective or cognitive observations for a specific event. Rather, this research aimed to obtain an overall perceived assessment of each day. Using daily diaries therefore enabled the participants to fill in the survey at their own convenience, which added to the response rate. To further reduce non-responses and dropouts – which can occur due to diary studies being burdensome [@ohly2010]– the number of daily questionnaires was capped to 10, as done in previous research [see @vleugels2018]. The daily assessments were capped to a maximum of 5-7 minutes, as suggested by @ohly2010, to maintain the willingness of participants.

At the end of the sprint, a closing survey was sent to the members of the team and the team’s supervisor. The closing survey for the team was an extended version of the daily surveys. The survey for the team supervisor focused on assessing the perceived intrapreneurial behaviour of the team. The supervisor’s answers ensured triangulation of the perceived data of the time, as such increasing the validity of the findings and preventing common rater bias [@kristof2005].

## 3.2 Data collection

### 3.2.1 Sample recruitment & size

The collected data for this research was gathered with teams active in software development. Software development teams commonly work according to agile methodologies such as Scrum or Kanban. Typically, these teams are self-organising and autonomous. Scrum, for example, has the key philosophy of becoming more proficient, as team, in the leading values of Scrum – namely commitment, focus, openness, respect, and courage – to be successful [@scrumGuide]. The primary focus of a Scrum team is to make the best possible progress towards the goals they set.

Given the Scrum values and similar values of other agile methods, researching this study's hypotheses in software development teams is expected to yield interesting results. Companies using Scrum are likely to expect their teams to exhibit innovative behaviours, such as adaptation, and self-management is an essential pillar of Scrum [@scrumGuide]. Additionally, agile teams are typically together for an extensive period. This prevents diluting the effects of socialisation behaviour typically seen at newcomers in an organisation [@yu2016; @vleugels2022].

To narrow the diversity of organisations participating in this research, teams were required to work in a commercial, for-profit organisation. Survey participants were expected to be from various nationalities, and the survey was therefore in English.

@ohly2010 emphasised recruiting many persons for participation in diary studies. Empirical data shows that diary studies lose around 20% of their participants [@ohly2010]. Moreover, higher numbers of participants impact statistical power more strongly compared to a higher number of dailies [@scherbaum2009]. Teams were recruited via the network of the researcher via direct requests, public LinkedIn messages, and via the network of the researcher's employer. Ultimately 72 organisations were contacted, of which 14 (19%) agreed to participate with a single team or more.

### 3.2.2 Collection procedure

The data for this research was collected in three phases ([@tbl:collection-approach]). The study recognises two types of respondents, team members and supervisors. Team members are those actively participating in the team’s development efforts. Members included software developers, engineers, and UX designers. Supervisors are people overseeing or steering the activities of the team, for example, team leads or product owners. The collection period was chosen by the team itself in correspondence with the researcher.

All surveys were sent digitally via email. The digital surveys were programmed in the software Qualtrics. The T0 survey was sent a week before the start of the daily collection period and had to be filled in before the first daily. All dailies were sent at 15:30 and only active for the day they were sent out. Participants were free to ignore a survey due to a day off or work for another team. Lastly, a T1 survey was sent directly after the dailies phase. For both T0 and T1, a reminder was sent on the third day. Participants had the option to opt-out of any email sent to them, effectively stopping their participation in the survey. Ultimately, the supervisors data is only used for supplementary analysis to control main model findings.

## 3.3 Measures

All measurement items are presented in Appendix A. For all items, a 7-point Likert scale was used.

### 3.3.1 Intrapreneurial behaviour

Intrapreneurial behaviour was measured using the validated measurement of [@deJong2015]. This measurement has been proven to measure the dimensions of proactiveness, innovativeness and risk-taking. This measurement was used in the daily and the T1 surveys. The T1 survey, both for team members and the supervisor, consisted of nine items. An example item is “I generate creative ideas”. For the daily a shorter three-item construct [@deJong2015] was used.

The daily construct has had a Cronbach’s $\alpha$ of .65, which denotes it as a construct with a doubtful internal consistency. Typically, a score higher than .7 is deemed acceptable, and a score higher than .9 is considered excellent. Removing any items would not increase the consistency. The removal of any of the items would consequently lead to the removing of a measurement for one of the variables: proactiveness, innovativeness, or risk-taking.

Another measure of internal consistency is composite reliability. Compared to Cronbach's $\alpha$ composite reliability does not assume all indicator loadings represent the same population. The study's data might violate this assumption and as such result into a lower value. The composite reliability for intrapreneurial behaviour was .70. @hair2021 state that .70 is the minimum threshold for internal consistency reliability. Considering the moderate Cronbach's $\alpha$ and the acceptable value for composite reliability, the construct was deemed consistant enough for use in this study.

For the T1 survey the nine-item construct had a Cronbach's $\alpha$ of .97 for the team members. For the supervisor survey the construct had a Cronbach's $\alpha$ of .98.

### 3.3.2 Autonomy (mis)fit

To determine the (mis)fit of autonomy for an individual the construct of [@spreitzer1995] was used. The construct was used at T0 and for the daily surveys. To determine both the need and the supply, the same three items were asked with a different prefix. For the need, each item in the daily survey started with “Today, I found…”. “Today, I had…” was the prefix for the supply construct in the daily survey. The T0 survey had “I have/can…” as a prefix for the supply and “I find…” as prefix for the need.

This validated measurement consisted out of three items. "The opportunity to determine how I do my job" is an example item. Cronbach's alpha's for the various surveys were T0/Need: .93; T0/Supply: .94; T1/Need: .92; and T1/Supply: .89.

### 3.3.3 Psychological safety

Psychological safety was measured via the well-proven construct of @edmondson1999. As part of the T0 survey, participants were required to respond to seven items. Example items are "Members of this team are able to bring up problems and tough issues" and "Working with members of this team, my unique skills and talents are value and utilised".

The internal consistency of the construct psychological safety had a Cronbach $\alpha$ of .67, which is doubtful. Removing an item would not yield a higher reliability score. The composition reliability of this construct was .78, a value close to the minimum threshold of .8 for a five to nine-item construct [@netemeyer2003].

### 3.3.4 Control variables

Education was added to the T0 survey as a control variable. The meta-review study of @neessen2019 found that intrapreneurs have a higher educational level in comparison with other employees. Similarly, educational level influences job autonomy [@ross1992]. To discern participants’ educational level, the survey asked, “Which is your highest earned education?” Possible answers were high school, bachelor, master, doctorate, and other.

Prior experience has been shown to improve individuals’ ability to recognise opportunities [@neessen2019]. To prevent confounding results, a control variable for “first job” was added.

## 3.4 Data analysis

The data analysis was conducted using the program RStudio and the R packages ‘lavaan’ and ‘multcomp’. Lavaan enables latent variable modelling and provides a large variety of multivariate statistical models. Multcomp offers tests and confidence intervals for general linear hypotheses.

The reliability of the constructs in the survey is was tested by calculating Cronbach’s alphas ($\alpha$). The internal consistency is was deemed valid enough at if a score of .7 or higher was obtained. For constructs that didn’t did not meet this threshold –- or just barely met this threshold - – additional tests for reliability are were done using composite reliability.

The analysis of relations and effect between the variables was done using polynomial regression equations [@edwards1993]. Polynomial regression analysis allows researchers to analyse the effects of two predictor variables in relationship to an outcome [@shanock2010]. As an analytical technique, polynomial regression is often used to study Person-Environment fit (e.g. @edwards2009; @kristof2005; @yu2016). Polynomial regression equations notably allow for three-dimensional investigations of the effect of autonomy needs and supply on intrapreneurial behaviour. Polynomial regression analyses are generally performed using equation 1 shown below, where N = individual autonomy needs and S = organisational autonomy supplied.

\begin{equation}
\begin{gathered}
Z = b_0 + b_1N + b_2S + b_3N^2 + b_4NS + b_5S^2
\end{gathered}
\end{equation}

This research not only emphasises the interaction between needs and supplies on intrapreneurial behaviour but also assesses the potential moderating effect of psychological safety. To test this effect, psychological safety needs to be added to the main model and interaction. This was done by multiplying each factor in the model, as done previously @vogel2016. The equation including moderation is shown in equation 2, where PS is psychological safety. Before multiplication the values of psychological safety were standardised to a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.

\begin{equation}
\begin{gathered}
Z = b*0 + b_1N + b_2S + b_3N^2 + b_4NS + b_5S^2 + \\ b_6PS + b_7PSxN + b_8PSxS + b_9PSxN^2 + b*{10}PSxNS + b\_{11}PSxS^2
\end{gathered}
\end{equation}

The results of the polynomial regression analysis were plotted in a three-dimensional space following Edwards & Parry (1993). The three-dimensional view allows for more explanatory potential than traditional moderated regression analyses [@shanock2010]. This view visualises the relationship of two predictor variables on the outcome variable along the line of congruence and incongruence. The resulting surfaces are helpful in the explanation and understanding of the discovered findings. The interpretation of the surfaces was done using four test variables: $a1$, $a2$, $a3$, and $a4$. The first two test variables were centred around the line of perfect agreement between the two predictor variables. The latter two are centred around the line of incongruence. Where $a1$ and $a3$ are both concerned with the slope of each line, $a2$ and $a4$ were used to evaluate the curvature of each corresponding line. Unstandardised values are used to calculate the as. The slope and curvature of the surface across low and high levels of psychological safety were computed by substituting values one standard deviation above and below the mean of intrapreneurial behaviour [@cohen2014].

### 3.4.1 Dataset preparation

For the analysis, all data was exported from Qualtrics into Google Sheets. Relevant data was merged into a single worksheet in a short row format. The daily surveys acted as the base for the worksheet. Each daily was a single row including extra data, such as psychological safety from the T0 survey added as additional columns. This process resulted in a workable dataset for polynomial regression analysis in RStudio. Partial surveys were deleted from the dataset. For the dailies, eight unfinished surveys were deleted, resulting in 336 useful datapoints.

A total of 24 teams participated in the daily studies. The number of unique participants was 79, of which 57% filled in the daily survey at least four times or more. Only two participants (2.5%) filled in all 10 surveys. A total of 135 participants registered to participate. With 79 unique persons responding, the response rate was 59%.

Not all respondents of the daily survey filled in the T0 survey. Twenty participants did not fill in the T0 survey, resulting in missing information on psychological safety. As RStudio can cope with partial information and the data is still useful for testing hypothesis 1 and hypothesis 2, the daily surveys of these 20 people were not removed from the analysis. The T0 was opened by 73 respondents, of which only 59 completed the survey (81%).

### 3.4.2 Characteristics of the survey participants

The characteristics of the survey participants represent only those respondents that entered at least one daily survey and the T0 survey. The respondents were pre-dominantly male (87%). Most respondents worked full-time (88%), meaning 36 hours or more per week. The ages of the respondents ranged between 21 and 64 ($M=36.81$, $SD=9.21$) and ,most were highly educated (87% had at least an bachelor's degree).

## 3.5 Methodological issues

Conducting research can lead to various methodological issues that potentially harm the reliability of the research. To prevent these from occurring, preventative measures were taken.

**Non-response**, To prevent non-responses, the recommendations of @ohly2010 were incorporated into the research design. Limiting the number of surveys and making it easy to complete them helps prevent non-responses. Starting from the fourth distribution group, a personal introduction email was sent to the participants. The email outlined the goals of the survey and allowed participants to more easily communicate with the researcher in case they had questions.

**Internal validity**, To raise the internal validity of the research, all constructs were taken from well-tested sources. For example, the construct of psychological safety is an often-used construct in similar settings of research.

**Reliability**, The reliability of the research was enhanced through the use of temporal sampling. The three main constructs are surveyed in either T0 and the daily surveys or the daily surveys and T1. This allowed for the triangulation of the data.
