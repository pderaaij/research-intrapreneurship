## 5.1 Conclusion

As organisations are continuously striving for innovation, managers are searching for ways to boost their innovative capabilities throughout their organisation. Intrapreneurship, a bottom-up process of recognising and exploiting opportunities, is a way to boost innovative behaviour. The phenomenon of intrapreneurship is well-researched, but many questions still are unanswered. This research attempts to shed a light on the relation between autonomy (mis)fit on intrapreneurial behaviour. A relationship that potentially can be influenced by levels of psychological safety in a team. As such the research looks into the relationship of psychological safety on autonomy (mis)fit and intrapreneurial behaviour. Two dominant views are prevalent in academic literature. The affective-consistency view argues that fit has to exist for autonomy needs and supplies in order to get intrapreneurial behaviour. An opposite view is held by the self-regulatory view. This view argues a misfit is required to get people moving.

The relationships between the study variables were first tested for correlation. A significant positive correlation was found between individual autonomy needs and intrapreneurial behaviour. Organisational autonomy supplied has significant correlations with intrapreneurial behaviour (negative) and psychological safety (positive). The control variable education has a significant negative relation with psychological safety. All other correlations don't show significant correlations and were discarded for further analysis.

Detailed analysis via polynomial regression analysis show insignificant conclusions for the study's main model. The effect of the predictor variables individual autonomy needs and organisational autonomy supplied on the outcome of intrapreneurial behaviour. Both the coefficients of the polynomial regression as the surfaces tests (the 4a's) failed to yield significant results.

Expanding the model with psychological safety does only find a significant result for low psychological safety environments. Along the line of incongruence the surface test for slope yielded a significant positive relation. Curvature along this line yielded a significant negative relation. All other tests yielded in insignificant results.

Concluding, for all hypothesis in this study not enough evidence could be found to either support of discard its premises.

## 5.2 Discussion

### 5.2.1 The role of autonomy on intrapreneurial behaviour

Autonomy is becoming a more prominent work characteristic in order to leverage digital technologies and innovation [@stiglbauer2018; @mueckeHowDoesJob2019]. As an influential factor on intrapreneurial behaviour [@deJong2015; @neessen2019] this research has studied the effects of autonomy on intrapreneurial behaviour. The Person-Environment fit theory, more specifically needs-supplies fit, has been used as a lens to investigate the relationships between our main study variables. Person-Environment fit is generally defined as the compatibility between individuals and their environment [@vanVianen2018].

This study was not able to find a significant relation between autonomy (mis)fit and intrapreneurial behaviour. Specifically, a relation between our two predictor variables and the outcome of intrapreneurial behaviour. The lack of a significant result is peculiar given the meta reviews of @neessen2019 and @blanka2019. Both reviews clearly indicate autonomy related to intrapreneurial behaviour.

Explanations for this peculiar behaviour can be found in two elements. First, this study tested autonomy in a broad sense. The questions of @spreitzer1995 test for job autonomy, decision making, and freedom. As a whole a significant relation could not be found, but analysis on individual items did yield significant results. Except, only when separating the individual need from the organisational supplied autonomy. The second element offers an explanation for this.

@edwards2006 recognises three approaches to person-environment fit: (a) atomistic, which separates the person and the environment; (b) molecular, which looks at the discrepancy between person and environment; and (c) molar, which focus on the perceived match or fit between the person and environment. Figure [-@fig:edwards-pe-fit] visualises these three approaches. In our study we followed a atomistic approach. The needs and supply of autonomy has been evaluated as separate entities, yielding in insignificant results. This approach has been followed by @yu2016. @@ add more research.

Many studies, like in the affective-consistency view, test autonomy via a molar approach. @deJong2011 sees job autonomy as a design variable and implicitly sees it as a (mis)fit between person and environment. @@ add more research

It raises the question if the affective-consistency view and self-regulatory view are competing views. The affective-consistency view seems to be centred around the molar approach, whereas the self-regulatory view uses the atomistic approach. Rather then being competing, the two views look at the same relationship with different approaches.

Given the atomistic approach of this study autonomy in its relation with intrapreneurial behaviour can be reviewed more thoroughly. The study findings suggest autonomy should not be viewed as a needs-supplies fit in relationship with IB. Rather, both variables should be seen as distinct variables. This is supported by an insignificant result on the interaction term of individual need and organisation supply (table [-@tbl:model-poly]).

### 5.2.2 Psychological safety as influencer

Today's work is accomplished in collaboration [@edmondsonLei2014; @frazier2017; @newman2017]. Psychological safety is an important factor in how people collaborate to achieve a shared outcome [@edmondsonLei2014]. This shared belief makes member feel safe for interpersonal risk-taking, a key characteristic of intrapreneurial behaviour [@neessen2019].

This study has not found any significant relationship between psychological safety and intrapreneurial behaviour. This finding has repeatedly been found in the study by comparing psychological safety with the daily measurements, the self-reported T1 measurement, and the supervisor reported T1 measurement. The lack of a significant relationship is contradicting with previous research. @mahmoud2021 found a significant relationship between psychological safety and intrapreneurial behaviour in it's research among Nigerian middle managers. This difference might be explained due to cultural differences or due to differences in individual roles. @@ add substance to explanations

Although no direct relation between psychological safety and intrapreneurial behaviour has been found, a significant moderating effect has been found. In low psychological safe environment supply high levels of autonomy has a negative effect on individuals that does not desire autonomy. A chicken or egg question arises in this case. Does the lack of desire for autonomy originates due to the low psychological safety or does low desire result into perceiving the environment as psychologically unsafe. In any case, providing an excess of autonomy to an individual harms the intrapreneurial behaviour low psychological safe environments.s

In that same low environment the highest levels of intrapreneurial behaviour are seen when the desire for autonomy is slightly larger than supplied by the organisation [@fig:low-psy-supply-zero]. This finding is in line with @yu2016 finding that a slight misfit results into positive behaviour. @@ add explanation to the claim

## 5.3 Recommendations for practice

Organisations who are under constant pressure to innovate can benefit from supporting intrapreneurship in their organisation. Facilitating and supporting this intrapreneurial behaviour can be of influence in the ability to develop new products or services, or self-renewal. This research has not been able to provide significant relationships between autonomy (mis)fit and intrapreneurial behaviour, and psychological safety and intrapreneurial behaviour.

Nevertheless, the study's findings do suggest that individual autonomy needs and organisational supplied autonomy should be looked at as individual components. In the context of attraction and selection organisation should not be concerned if the individual needs matches the organisational supply. Rather, organisations should question and evaluate what the experience of a candidate is perceived a large or small amount of autonomy. These answers and insights might tell more about the behaviour and characteristic of the candidate, then a hypothetical fit between needs and supply.

Although individuals strive for perfect fit, achieving this fit is a rare situation [@vanVianen2018]. This would suggest that most people are in a situation of misfit and a form of discomfort. The significant finding in low psychological safe environments show that a small deficient misfit leads to higher levels of intrapreneurial behaviour. Instead of striving for a needs-supplies fit, organisations should rather emphasise on training and support systems to help employees with handling this misfit.

This study finds that an excess of autonomy, when little is desired, in low psychological safe environments lead to a lack of intrapreneurial behaviour. When an organisations finds intrapreneurial behaviour low, additional analysis of psychological safety should be executed. For example, via anonymous surveys using the seven-items of @edmondson1999. If this yields low scores, the organisation might consider reducing the provided autonomy. Organisations that regularly conduct employee satisfaction surveys (e.g. eNPS) could consider adding this set of questions to their survey.

## 5.4 Recommendations for research

### 5.4.1 Limitations of this research

This research has contributed to the academic field, but also bears some limitations. For all hypothesis this study has not been able to find supportive evidence. As such, this study primarily raises new questions and does not provide definitive answers.

The collected data is gathered by self-reports. Potentially this could lead to common-method bias. Meaning, that answers are reported in a consistent manner [@podsakoff2003]. Partially this is being prevented by temporal repetition. For intrapreneurial behaviour this is also prevented due to the supervisor rating in the T1 survey.

### 5.4.2 Recommendations for further research

The relationship between autonomy and intrepreneurial behaviour has found to hold many questions for answering. Likewise, the influence of psychological safety yields enough questions to be answered in future research.

Are the self-regulatory view and the affective-consistency view competing views, or are they concerned about different things. The three approaches towards PE-fit of @edwards2006 offers a wealth of opportunities to explore this question. Future research that combines the atomistic and molar approach could provide insight what the effects is of both approaches on intrapreneurial behaviour. It could be that the atomistic approach tends to measure different things then the molar approach. Whether or not correct, if an answer is found it can set directions for future research.

This study was not able to find a direct relationship between psychological safety and intrapreneurial behaviour. The study of @mahmoud2021 was able to find this relationship. Additional research could shed light on the presence of this relationship and potential influencing factors as culture or organisational role.

In low psychological safe environments this study found a high supply of autonomy when none is desired to lead to low intrapreneurial behaviour. Further research could answer the question of directionality. Does the low level of desired autonomy originate from low levels of psychological safety or do other factors play a role here.
