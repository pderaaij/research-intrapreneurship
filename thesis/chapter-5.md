@@ for in conclusions
For better understanding of the surface modelling three-dimensional illustrations are supplied. Analysis for our main model is reported in table [-@tbl:surface-response] and illustrated in figure [`@fig:sra-main-model]. For all 4 a's the main model yielded insignificant results. This suggests that a (mis)fit of autonomy on intrapreneurial behaviour - the interaction between N and S - is influenced by other factors. As such both **hypothesis 1** and **hypothesis 2** lack evidence.

## tl;dr on conclusions

Given these results we can conclude:

- Contradicting effects happen for autonomy needs and supply in regards to IB. This suggests that autonomy NS-fit on intrapreneurial behaviour is irrelevant, and has to be seen as two distinct variables
  - This claim is based on the lack of significance between N and S when they interact (NxS)
  - And it moving the opposite direction in case of 1% increases; e.g. it is interesting that IB decreases on an increase of org supply
  - @@ Jana; could above be explained by some weird outliers?
- The effect of autonomy (needs and supply) on intrapreneurial behaviour is clouded by effects not studied in these thesis
  - There is no direct relation between autonomy and IB, there are other/different constructs mediating/moderating between these two variables
  - This allows for opportunities to further research the moderating or mediating effects between autonomy and intrapreneurial behaviour
- In a low psychological safety environment supplying high levels of autonomy has a negative effect on individuals with low desire for autonomy
- A relation between psychological safety and IB has not been found in this study.
