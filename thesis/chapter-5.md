## 5.1 Conclusion

As organisations are continuously striving for innovation, managers are searching for ways to boost their innovative capabilities throughout their organisation. Intrapreneurship, a bottom-up process of recognising and exploiting opportunities, is a way to boost innovative behaviour. The phenomenon of intrapreneurship is well-researched, but many questions still are unanswered. This research attempts to shed a light on the relation between autonomy (mis)fit on intrapreneurial behaviour. A relationship that potentially can be influenced by levels of psychological safety in a team. Because of that the research looks into the relationship of psychological safety on autonomy (mis)fit and intrapreneurial behaviour. Two dominant views are prevalent in academic literature. The affective-consistency view argues that fit has to exist for autonomy needs and supplies in order to get intrapreneurial behaviour. An opposite view is held by the self-regulatory view. This view argues a misfit is required to get people moving.

This research used polynomial regression and response surface methodology to examine the PE-fit of autonomy on intrapreneurial behaviour. It offers a thorough understanding of the effects between the two predictor variables and the outcome. Two models are created to test and understand these effects.

The main model tested the effect of autonomy need (person) and autonomy supply (environment) on intrapreneurial behaviour (outcome). Results of the polynomial regression analysis did not yield any significant results. Importantly, the interaction between needs and supply does not show a distinct relationship between intrapreneurial behaviour. The lack of distinct relationship does not speak in favour of the affective-consistency view which argues that fit is required to get the desired outcome of intrapreneurial behaviour. The lack of mathematical proof along the line of perfect fit ($a1$ - slope, [@tbl:surface-response]) aids in questioning the validness for the affective-consistency view in the context of autonomy fit and intrapreneurial behaviour.

Characteristics of psychological safety display similarity with antecedents of intrapreneurial behaviour at first sight. This research examined the prevalence of a direct relationship between psychological safety and intrapreneurial behaviour. A relationship which not has been found. Although a direct relationship lacked, psychological safety could still have a moderating effect between autonomy (mis)fit and psychological safety. Conclusive statements could not be found. For high psychological safe environments no significant results could be found.

For low psychological safe environments this research finds that a large excess of autonomy leads to low intrapreneurial behaviour ([@fig:sra-psy]). Especially when the individual need for autonomy is at its lowest, any excess of autonomy has negative consequences on intrapreneurial behaviour. This concave surface, or in simpler terms the lower intrapreneurial behaviour when needs and supplies diverge, fits the affective-consistency view.

## 5.2 Discussion

### 5.2.1 The role of autonomy on intrapreneurial behaviour

Autonomy is becoming a more prominent work characteristic in order to leverage digital technologies and innovation [@stiglbauer2018; @mueckeHowDoesJob2019]. As an influential factor on intrapreneurial behaviour [@deJong2015; @neessen2019] this research has studied the effects of autonomy on intrapreneurial behaviour. The Person-Environment fit theory, more specifically needs-supplies fit, has been used as a lens to investigate the relationships between our main study variables. Person-Environment fit is generally defined as the compatibility between individuals and their environment [@vanVianen2018].

This study was not able to find a significant relation between autonomy (mis)fit and intrapreneurial behaviour. Specifically, a relation between our two predictor variables and the outcome of intrapreneurial behaviour. This is, for example, displayed by the lack of significance on the interaction between needs and supplies ([@tbl:model-poly]). Given the meta reviews of @neessen2019 and @blanka2019 this finding might seem peculiar. Explanations for this peculiar behaviour can be found in three elements.

First and foremost, the meta reviews describe autonomy from a supply perspective. For example, @neessen2019 states: “... giving employees autonomy in their work is one of the other dimensions that influence the intrapreneur. Giving the employee the freedom to design his/her work and to decentralise the decision-making process results in more intrapreneurial activities” (p. 15). In contrast this research provides a Person-Environment fit lens on the relationship between autonomy and intrapreneurial behaviour. As such, the findings of this research show that the PE-fit lens leads to new and interesting questions.

The importance of applying a different lens is offered by @edwards2006. In this paper Edwards recognises three approaches to person-environment fit: (a) atomistic, which separates the person and the environment; (b) molecular, which looks at the discrepancy between person and environment; and (c) molar, which focus on the perceived match or fit between the person and environment. Figure [-@fig:edwards-pe-fit] visualises these three approaches.

Studies used in the meta reviews test autonomy via a molar approach. For example, @deJong2011 sees job autonomy as a design variable and implicitly sees it as a (mis)fit between person and environment. On that same note @rigtering2013 looks at the given autonomy to make own decisions and control their own job as factor for intrapreneurial behaviour.

![Phenomonology of person-environment fit [@edwards2006]](./thesis/figures/edwards-phenomonology-pe-fit.png){#fig:edwards-pe-fit}

This study followed a atomistic approach. We have evaluated the needs and supply of autonomy as separate entities. A similar approach as @yu2016 and @vogel2016. Given the atomistic approach of this study autonomy in its relation with intrapreneurial behaviour can be reviewed more thoroughly. The study findings suggest autonomy should not be viewed as a needs-supplies fit in relationship with intrapreneurial behaviour. Rather, both variables should be seen as distinct variables. A conclusion supported by an insignificant result on the interaction term of individual need and organisation supply (table [-@tbl:model-poly]).

It raises the question if the affective-consistency view and self-regulatory view are competing views. The affective-consistency view seems to be centred around the molar approach, whereas the self-regulatory view uses the atomistic approach. Rather then being competing, the two views might look at the same relationship with different approaches. With the risk of interpreting relationships, its origins, and consequences differently.

Finally, this study tested autonomy in a broad sense of the concept. The questions of @spreitzer1995 test for job autonomy, decision making, and freedom. As a group of three elements, both for individual need and organisational supply, a significant relation with intrapreneurial behaviour could not be found. Additional analysis ([@tbl:regs-autonomy]) repeated this finding for each distinct element.

### 5.2.2 Psychological safety as influencer

Today's work is accomplished in collaboration [@edmondsonLei2014; @frazier2017; @newman2017]. Psychological safety is an important factor in how people collaborate to achieve a shared outcome [@edmondsonLei2014]. This shared belief makes member feel safe for interpersonal risk-taking, a key characteristic of intrapreneurial behaviour [@neessen2019].

This study has not found any significant relationship between psychological safety and intrapreneurial behaviour. This finding has repeatedly been found in the study by comparing psychological safety with the daily measurements, the self-reported T1 measurement, and the supervisor reported T1 measurement. The lack of a significant relationship is contradicting with recently published research. @mahmoud2021 found a significant relationship between psychological safety and intrapreneurial behaviour. That research investigated this relationship in Nigeria and with middle-managers. Differences might be explained due to role or culture. For example, @edmondsonLei2014 notes: “employees in certain cultures may be particularly hesitant to ask questions, provide feedback, or openly disagree with their superiors” (p. 8). Low impact of psychological safety on outcomes is not uncommon. The review of @edmondsonLei2014 summarises that the impact of psychological safety was low when individuals had more confidence in the knowledge shared. When work was certain and less dependent on learning, the impact of psychological safety was lower. Boundary conditions potentially play a role in the impact psychological can have.

Although no direct relation between psychological safety and intrapreneurial behaviour has been found, a significant moderating effect has been found. In low psychological safe environment supply high levels of autonomy has a negative effect on individuals that does not desire autonomy. A chicken or egg question arises in this case. Does the lack of desire for autonomy originates due to the low psychological safety or does low desire result into perceiving the environment as psychologically unsafe. In any case, providing an excess of autonomy to an individual harms the intrapreneurial behaviour low psychological safe environments.

In that same low environment the highest levels of intrapreneurial behaviour are seen when the desire for autonomy is slightly larger than supplied by the organisation. This finding is in line with @yu2016 finding that a slight misfit results into positive behaviour. @@ add explanation to the claim

## 5.3 Recommendations for practice

Organisations who are under constant pressure to innovate can benefit from supporting intrapreneurship in their organisation. Facilitating and supporting this intrapreneurial behaviour can be of influence in the ability to develop new products or services, or self-renewal. This research has not been able to provide significant relationships between autonomy (mis)fit and intrapreneurial behaviour, and psychological safety and intrapreneurial behaviour.

Nevertheless, the study's findings suggest that individual autonomy needs and organisational supply of autonomy should be seen as individual components. Allowing organisations to change their hiring and selection strategy. Searching for candidates with close to perfect fit leads to a narrow group of possible candidates.

Although individuals strive for perfect fit, achieving this fit is a rare situation [@vanVianen2018]. This would suggest that most people are in a situation of misfit and a form of discomfort. The significant finding in low psychological safe environments show that a small deficient misfit leads to higher levels of intrapreneurial behaviour. Instead of striving for a needs-supplies fit, organisations should rather emphasise on training and support systems to help employees with handling this misfit.

This study finds that an excess of autonomy, when little is desired, in low psychological safe environments lead to a lack of intrapreneurial behaviour. When an organisations finds intrapreneurial behaviour low, additional analysis of psychological safety should be executed. For example, via anonymous surveys using the seven-items of @edmondson1999. If this yields low scores, the organisation might consider reducing the provided autonomy. Organisations that regularly conduct employee satisfaction surveys (e.g. eNPS) could consider adding this set of questions to their survey.

## 5.4 Recommendations for research

This research has contributed to the academic field, but also bears some limitations. For all hypotheses this study has not been able to find supportive evidence. As such, this study primarily raises new questions and does not provide definitive answers.

Data for this study was collected following a diary study (12 points) and a single supervisor survey. Although this allowed for triangulation of the data, the dataset is predominantly gathered by self-reports. Potentially this could lead to common-method bias. Meaning, that answers are reported in a consistent manner [@podsakoff2003]. Teams that participated in the survey have not participated as a whole. From each team only a few individuals filled in one or more surveys. This could have raised self-selection issues. Future research could design for this limitations by reducing the number of timepoints. Effectively reducing the effort to participate for all team members.

The relationship between autonomy and intrapreneurial behaviour has found to hold many questions for answering. Likewise, the influence of psychological safety yields enough questions to be answered in future research. Are the self-regulatory view and the affective-consistency view competing views, or are they concerned about different things. The three approaches towards PE-fit of @edwards2006 offers a wealth of opportunities to explore this question. Future research that combines the atomistic and molar approach could provide insight what the effects is of both approaches on intrapreneurial behaviour. It could be that the atomistic approach tends to measure different things then the molar approach. Potentially this might provide answers with regards to the views of self-regulation and affective-consistency.

This study was not able to find a direct relationship between psychological safety and intrapreneurial behaviour. Additional research should further investigate the presence of this relationship. There might be potential influencing factors as culture or organisational role. Contextual elements as certainty of work or learning behaviour could influence the relation between the two constructs as well. A large set of questions and possibilities is yet to be researched and analysed in future research.

A high supply of autonomy, when none is desired, leads to low intrapreneurial behaviour in low psychological safe environments. Further research could answer the question of directionality. Does the low level of desired autonomy originate from low levels of psychological safety or do other factors play a role here. A better understanding for this directionality is primarily useful for organisations. If it origins from low psychological safety organisations have ample opportunities to better the situations, for example by trainings and support systems. If other factors are at play it might affect hiring and selection strategies and as such reduce the potential pool of candidates to hire.
