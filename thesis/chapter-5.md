# 5 Conclusion, discussion, and recommendations

## 5.1 Conclusion

As organisations are continuously striving for innovation, managers are searching for ways to boost their innovative capabilities throughout their organisation. Intrapreneurship, a bottom-up process of recognising and exploiting opportunities, is a way to boost innovative behaviour. The phenomenon of intrapreneurship is well-researched, but many questions still are unanswered. This research attempts to shed a light on the relation between autonomy (mis)fit on intrapreneurial behaviour. A relationship that potentially can be influenced by levels of psychological safety in a team. As such the research looks into the relationship of psychological safety on autonomy (mis)fit and intrapreneurial behaviour. Two dominant views are prevalent in academic literature. The affective-consistency view argues that fit has to exist for autonomy needs and supplies in order to get intrapreneurial behaviour. An opposite view is held by the self-regulatory view. This view argues a misfit is required to get people moving.

The relationships between the study variables were first tested for correlation. A significant positive correlation was found between individual autonomy needs and intrapreneurial behaviour. Organisational autonomy supplied has significant correlations with intrapreneurial behaviour (negative) and psychological safety (positive). The control variable education has a significant negative relation with psychological safety. All other correlations don't show significant correlations and were discarded for further analysis.

Detailed analysis via polynomial regression analysis show insignificant conclusions for the study's main model. The effect of the predictor variables individual autonomy needs and organisational autonomy supplied on the outcome of intrapreneurial behaviour. Both the coefficients of the polynomial regression as the surfaces tests (the 4a's) failed to yield significant results.

Expanding the model with psychological safety does only find a significant result for low psychological safety environments. Along the line of incongruence the surface test for slope yielded a significant positive relation. Curvature along this line yielded a significant negative relation. All other tests yielded in insignificant results.

Concluding, for all hypothesis in this study not enough evidence could be found to either support of discard its premises.

## 5.2 Discussion

### 5.2.1 The role of autonomy on intrapreneurial behaviour

Autonomy is becoming a more prominent work characteristic in order to leverage digital technologies and innovation [@stiglbauer2018; @mueckeHowDoesJob2019]. As an influential factor on intrapreneurial behaviour [@deJong2015; @neessen2019] this research has studied the effects of autonomy on intrapreneurial behaviour. The Person-Environment fit theory, more specifically needs-supplies fit, has been used as a lens to investigate the relationships between our main study variables. Person-Environment fit is generally defined as the compatibility between individuals and their environment [@vanVianen2018].

This study was not able to find a significant relation between autonomy (mis)fit and intrapreneurial behaviour. Specifically, a relation between our two predictor variables and the outcome of intrapreneurial behaviour. The lack of a significant result is peculiar given the meta reviews of @neessen2019 and @blanka2019. Both reviews clearly indicate autonomy related to intrapreneurial behaviour.

Explanations for this peculiar behaviour can be found in two elements. First, this study tested autonomy in a broad sense. The questions of @spreitzer1995 test for job autonomy, decision making, and freedom. As a whole a significant relation could not be found, but analysis on individual items did yield significant results. Except, only when separating the individual need from the organisational supplied autonomy. The second element offers an explanation for this.

@edwards2006 recognises three approaches to person-environment fit: (a) atomistic, which separates the person and the environment; (b) molecular, which looks at the discrepancy between person and environment; and (c) molar, which focus on the perceived match or fit between the person and environment. Figure [-@fig:edwards-pe-fit] visualises these three approaches. In our study we followed a atomistic approach. The needs and supply of autonomy has been evaluated as separate entities, yielding in insignificant results. This approach has been followed by @yu2016. @@ add more research.

Many studies, like in the affective-consistency view, test autonomy via a molar approach. @deJong2011 sees job autonomy as a design variable and implicitly sees it as a (mis)fit between person and environment. @@ add more research

Given the atomistic approach of this study autonomy in its relation with intrapreneurial behaviour can be reviewed more thoroughly. The study findings suggest autonomy should not be viewed as a needs-supplies fit. Rather, both variables should be seen as distinct variables. This is supported by an insignificant result on the interaction term of individual need and organisation supply (table [-@tbl:model-poly]).

- The effect of autonomy (needs and supply) on intrapreneurial behaviour is clouded by effects not studied in these thesis
  - There is no direct relation between autonomy and IB, there are other/different constructs mediating/moderating between these two variables
  - This allows for opportunities to further research the moderating or mediating effects between autonomy and intrapreneurial behaviour

@@ Analysis shows contradicting effects between individual autonomy needs and organisational autonomy supplied. The Person-Environment fit theory would suggest that as both the need and supply changes, it has the same effect on the intrapreneurial behaviour outcome. In other words, each increase of need and supply would yield in an increase of intrapreneurial behaviour.

### 5.2.2 Psychological safety as influencer

Today's work is accomplished in collaboration [@edmondsonLei2014; @frazier2017; @newman2017]. Psychological safety is an important factor in how people collaborate to achieve a shared outcome [@edmondsonLei2014]. This shared belief makes member feel safe for interpersonal risk-taking, a key characteristic of intrapreneurial behaviour [@neessen2019].

This study has not found any significant relationship between psychological safety and intrapreneurial behaviour. This finding has repeatedly been found in the study by comparing psychological safety with the daily measurements, the self-reported T1 measurement, and the supervisor reported T1 measurement. The lack of a significant relationship is contradicting with previous research. @mahmoud2021 found a significant relationship between psychological safety and intrapreneurial behaviour in it's research among Nigerian middle managers. This difference might be explained due to cultural differences or due to differences in individual roles. @@ add substance to explanations

Although no direct relation between psychological safety and intrapreneurial behaviour has been found, a significant moderating effect has been found. In low psychological safe environment supply high levels of autonomy has a negative effect on individuals that does not desire autonomy. A chicken or egg question arises in this case. Does the lack of desire for autonomy originates due to the low psychological safety or does low desire result into perceiving the environment as psychologically unsafe. In any case, providing an excess of autonomy to an individual harms the intrapreneurial behaviour low psychological safe environments.s

In that same low environment the highest levels of intrapreneurial behaviour are seen when the desire for autonomy is slightly larger than supplied by the organisation [@fig:low-psy-supply-zero]. This finding is in line with @yu2016 finding that a slight misfit results into positive behaviour. @@ add explanation to the claim

## 5.3 Recommendations for practice

- careful management of individual autonomy needs and supplies. Striving for fit might be counteractive. Especially when recruiting potential employees might be lost for no reason.
- Attention for psychological safety. As low psychological safety is killing for IB
- When psy safe is low and IB is required, either invest to raise psychological safety of bring in expertise/instruction and require less autonomy. Just execute the instructions.

## 5.4 Recommendations for research

### 5.4.1 Limitations of this research

- Part of a larger set of questions, more focused surveys could yield to a higher and more consistent response rate

### 5.4.2 Recommendations for further research
