## New hypothesis - for reference

1 A perceived needs-supplies (congruent) fit on autonomy will positively relate to intrapreneurial behaviour, resulting into an U-shape curve

2 A perceived needs-supplies (incongruent) misfit on autonomy will positively relate to intrapreneurial behaviour, resulting in an reversed U-shape curve

3 Psychological safety is positively related to intrapreneurial behaviour

4a The positive relation of needs-supplies fit on autonomy will be stronger when psychological safety is high then when it is low

4b The positive relation of needs-supplies misfit on autonomy will be stronger when psychological safety is high then when it is low

@@ think about adding a control variable here

The means, standard deviations, and zero-order correlations for our variables are presented in table [-@tbl:descriptives]. It shows significant relations between individual autonomy needed and autonomy supplied, and between both autonomy variables intrapreneurial behaviour. Means and standard deviations for all variables suggest considerable variations.

Confirmatory factor analyses showed that the four-factor model in which the study variables were kept separate was a better fit to the data. The four-factor model ($\chi$<sup>2</sup> (98, N=269) = 401.566, $\rho$ < 0.001; comparative fit index (CFI) = .873; root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) = .107; standardised root mean square residual (SRMR) = .037) compared better then the one-factor model (x<sup>2</sup> (104, N=269) = 1443.527, $\rho$ < 0.001; CFI = .44; RMSEA = .219; SRMR = .17). An ANOVA test between the models showed a $\Delta\chi$<sup>2</sup> of 1042 with a $\rho$ < 0.001. The results of the four-factor model support the distinctiveness of the measures.

Contradictory the individual autonomy needs relate positively to intrapreneurial behaviour whereas supplied organisational autonomy relates negatively. This suggests that both needs and supply of autonomy has no congruent and incongruent effect [@@]. Multiple linear regression analysis ($\chi$<sup>2</sup> = 0.0423, F (266) = 5.874, $\rho$ < 0.01) confirms the contradictory findings. For every 1% increase in individual autonomy need an 0.24% increase of intrapreneurial behaviour is found ($\rho$ < 0.01). On organisational supplied autonomy each 1% increase leads to 0.17% decrease of intrapreneurial behaviour ($\rho$ < 0.05).

To further investigate this contradiction polynomial regression analysis is used. Results of this analysis are displayed in table [-@tbl:model-poly]
