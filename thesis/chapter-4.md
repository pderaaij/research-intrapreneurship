# 4. Results

## 4.1 Descriptive analysis

Table [-@tbl:descriptives] presents the means, standard deviations, and zero-order correlations for the variables. The survey origin is added for each variable. These origins have been used for analysing the main model. Supplementary analysis has been held to control the results of the main model. The supplementary analysis is reported in the last section of this chapter. Table [-@tbl:descriptives] shows significant relations between individual autonomy needs and organisational autonomy supplied, and between both autonomy variables intrapreneurial behaviour. Means and standard deviations for all variables suggest considerable variation and little evidence of floor or ceiling effects. It is noteworthy that both variables are significantly related to intrapreneurial behaviour but differ in direction. Polynomial regression analysis was particularly helpful in understanding what happened here. Regarding the control variables, only a significant relation between psychological safety and education was found. Since all other correlations were insignificant, the control variables were ignored in the further analysis of the data.

Confirmatory factor analyses showed that the four-factor model in which the studied variables were kept separate fit better to the data. The four-factor model ($\chi$<sup>2</sup> (98, N=269) = 401.566, $\rho$ < 0.001; comparative fit index (CFI) = .873; root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) = .107; standardised root mean square residual (SRMR) = .037) compared better than the one-factor model ($\chi$<sup>2</sup> (104, N=269) = 1443.527, $\rho$ < 0.001; CFI = .44; RMSEA = .219; SRMR = .17). An ANOVA test between the models showed a $\Delta\chi$<sup>2</sup> of 1042 with a $\rho$ < 0.001. The results of the four-factor model support the distinctiveness of the measures used in the study.

## 4.2 Polynomial regression analysis & response-surface modelling

The multiple linear regression analysis ($\chi$<sup>2</sup> = 0.0423, F (266) = 5.874, $\rho$ < 0.01) showed that individual autonomy needs and organisational autonomy supply exhibit different behaviour. For every 1% increase in individual autonomy need an 0.24% increase in intrapreneurial behaviour was found ($\rho$ < 0.01). Regarding organisational supplied autonomy each 1% increase led to 0.17% decrease in intrapreneurial behaviour ($\rho$ < 0.05). Polynomial regression analysis provides answers to the two predictive autonomy variables on the outcome variable, intrapreneurial behaviour. Following the protocol established by Edwards [-@edwards1993] the polynomial regression analysis was executed in a multi-step approach. The first step represents our main model of the relationship between person (individual autonomy needs), environment (organisational autonomy supply), and outcome (intrapreneurial behaviour). The second step adds the interaction with psychological safety as a moderator, which follows procedures set by @vogel2016. Results from both polynomial regressions are displayed in Table [-@tbl:model-poly]. $R^2$ results suggest that both models account for significant variance. Both models had low $R^2$ values. As this study tests a congruence hypothesis the $R^2$ values are not informative. For testing the hypotheses the pattern in the coefficients is crucial, and this pattern is not given by the $R^2$ (Edwards, personal communication).

To better understand polynomial regressions results; @shanock2010 recommends using three-dimensional visualisations. The analysis for the main model is illustrated in figure [-@fig:sra-main-model], figure [-@fig:sra-psy] illustrates the moderated model. Each surface shows the effect of (in)congruence between needs and supply along the outcome variable, intrapreneurial behaviour. As such, it allows for a richer interpretation of the results. Central elements in the visualised surface are the line of perfect agreement and the line of incongruence. Perfect agreement, the Y=X line, represents the situation that where individual autonomy needs matches the organisational supplied autonomy supplied by the organisation. In other words, this situation represents autonomy fit. The outcome of misfit on intrapreneurial behaviour is represented by what happens left or right from of the line of perfect fit shows the outcome of misfit on intrapreneurial behaviour. The opposite situation is captured by the line of incongruence, the Y=-X line. This line represents the situations where individual need is opposite of organisational supply. As such, it represents the relationship of perfect misfit (i.e., 7 on need and 1 on supply) on intrapreneurial behaviour. Complete incongruence is found in the top-left-top and bottom-right-bottom corner.

Important features of the surface are mathematically identified by four test values: $a1$, $a2$, $a3$, and $a4$ [@edwards1993]. The first two test variables are centred around the line of perfect agreement between the two predictor variables. The latter two are centred around the line of incongruence. Where a1 and a3 are both concerned with the slope of each line, a2 and a4 evaluate the curvature of each corresponding line. A significant positive slope value for a slope suggests that the outcome increases linearly as both predictors increase. A significant value for curvature tells something about indicates the degree of discrepancy. High curvature values for curvature indicates that divergence between the two predictors is of relevance in relationship to its outcome. For both our main model and moderating model the surface tests values are reported in Table [-@tbl:surface-response].

## 4.3 Hypothesis testing

> Hypothesis 1: (a) Intrapreneurial behaviour will be lower when individual autonomy need and organisational autonomy supply are both low and will be higher when both are high; (b) intrapreneurial behaviour will increase as organisational supply of autonomy increases towards individual autonomy need (fit), and will decrease as organisational supply exceeds individual need.

_Hypothesis 1:_ The premise of this hypothesis is that a fit of autonomy needs and supply is not only essential for intrapreneurial behaviour, but also will increase linearly as both need and supply increase (part a). Table [-@tbl:model-poly] shows the regression results for the main model. These results do not show any significant results for the individual terms or for the interaction of the terms. The three-dimensional response surface is illustrated in figure [-@fig:sra-main-model] and the corresponding test values are reported in table [-@tbl:surface-response].

For part a of this hypothesis, the values of a1 and a2 are particularly interesting, as they are focused on the line of perfect fit. A significant a1 would suggest a linear slope, whereas a significant a2 would suggest a non-linear slope. No significant result was found for both values, meaning there is no evidence to support hypothesis 1a. Part b claims that reducing the deficiency of autonomy leads to higher levels of intrapreneurial behaviour. If autonomy is excessive, this will lead to lower levels of intrapreneurial behaviour. This possibility would be visualised as a concave (low edges; high middle) surface in the surface model. A significant negative test value of a4 would mathematically support this concave surface. The visualised surface response [@fig:sra-main-model] suggests differently, but since the test values of a3 and a4 were both insignificant, no claim can be made. Thus, hypothesis 1b lacks supporting evidence.

> Hypothesis 2: (a) Intrapreneurial behaviour will be lower when individual autonomy need and organisational autonomy supply are both low or both high; (b) Intrapreneurial behaviour will increase when the difference between individual needs and organisational supply (misfit) increases.

_Hypothesis 2:_ Part a of this hypothesis suggests that perfect autonomy fit, either both low individual need and organisational supply, and high individual need and organisational supply, of autonomy would lead to respectively low or high levels of intrapreneurial behaviour. If correct, the surface of the main model in @fig:sra-main-model should illustrate a concave surface along the line of perfect fit. The test value of $a2$ ([@tbl:surface-response]) should be significant and negative as well. As the value of $a2$ was insignificant, no evidence exists in support of hypothesis 2a.

Part b of hypothesis 2 suggests that a degree of discrepancy between individual need and supply should exist, and the surface should be convex (high edges; low middle) along the line of incongruence. The surface in the main model ([@fig:sra-main-model]) instead is concave, and the test value of $a4$ ([@tbl:surface-response]) is insignificant. Consequently, no evidence supports hypothesis 2b.

> Hypothesis 3: Psychological safety is positively related to intrapreneurial behaviour

_Hypothesis 3:_ This hypothesis argues that psychological safety positively relates to intrapreneurial behaviour. An individual regression analysis for the relation between psychological safety and intrapreneurial behaviour was run to test this hypothesis. It showed an insignificant effect of .05 ($\chi$<sup>2</sup> = 0.0006, F (267) = 0.154, $\rho$ < 0.695) for they daily measurements. Thus, hypothesis 3 lacks supporting evidence.

> Hypothesis 4a: The positive relation of needs-supplies fit on autonomy will be stronger when psychological safety is high compared to when it is low

> Hypothesis 4b: The positive relation of needs-supplies misfit on autonomy will be stronger when psychological safety is high compared to when it is low

_Hypothesis 4:_ Hypotheses 4a and 4b both suggest that high levels of psychological safety are beneficial, regardless of whether a (mis)fit of autonomy needs and supply exists. To test these hypothesis surface models ([@fig:sra-psy]) and surface test values ([@tbl:surface-response]) were calculated for both low and high levels of psychological safety. Only for low levels of psychological environment significant values were found. The significant negative value of $a4$ - the curvature test along line of incongruence - mathematically represents a concave surface as shown in the figure. The significant negative value of $a3$ represents the directionality of the discrepancy. Along the line of incongruence an excess (supply > need) of autonomy is impacting intrapreneurial behaviour more than a deficiency of autonomy.

No significant results were found for environments with high psychological safety. Therefore, comparing the environments with low and high psychological safety would not lead to meaningful insights and hypothesis 4a and 4b are not supported.

## 4.4 Supplementary analysis

The main analysis was not able to find a revealed no significant relation between psychological safety and intrapreneurial behaviour. This relation was tested by using the three-item construct of intrapreneurial behaviour, a construct with a relatively weak Cronbach’s $\alpha$ of .65. The nine-item construct used in both T1 surveys had higher reliability scores. Therefore, control tests were run for psychological safety using on the T1 survey of the team members and on that for the supervisors. Both these tests also yielded insignificant results as well. The self-reported found an effect of .13 ($\chi$<sup>2</sup> = 0.0021, F (260) = 0.564, $\rho$ < 0.453) and the supervisor survey had a value of -.19 ($\chi$<sup>2</sup> = 0.0029, F (267) = 0.785, $\rho$ < 0.376). This lack of evidence further supports the rejection of hypothesis 3.
