## 4.1 Descriptive analysis

The means, standard deviations, and zero-order correlations for our variables are presented in table [-@tbl:descriptives]. It shows significant relations between individual autonomy needed and autonomy supplied, and between both autonomy variables intrapreneurial behaviour. Means and standard deviations for all variables suggest considerable variations and little evidence of floor or ceiling effects.

For our control variables only a significant relation between psychological safety and education has found. As all other correlations are insignificant the control variables are ignored for further analysis of the data.

Confirmatory factor analyses showed that the four-factor model in which the study variables were kept separate was a better fit to the data. The four-factor model ($\chi$<sup>2</sup> (98, N=269) = 401.566, $\rho$ < 0.001; comparative fit index (CFI) = .873; root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) = .107; standardised root mean square residual (SRMR) = .037) compared better then the one-factor model (x<sup>2</sup> (104, N=269) = 1443.527, $\rho$ < 0.001; CFI = .44; RMSEA = .219; SRMR = .17). An ANOVA test between the models showed a $\Delta\chi$<sup>2</sup> of 1042 with a $\rho$ < 0.001. The results of the four-factor model support the distinctiveness of the measures used in the study.

## 4.2 Hypothesis testing

@@Contradictory the individual autonomy needs relate positively to intrapreneurial behaviour whereas supplied organisational autonomy relates negatively. This suggests that both needs and supply of autonomy has no congruent and incongruent effect [@@]. Multiple linear regression analysis ($\chi$<sup>2</sup> = 0.0423, F (266) = 5.874, $\rho$ < 0.01) confirms the contradictory findings. For every 1% increase in individual autonomy need an 0.24% increase of intrapreneurial behaviour is found ($\rho$ < 0.01). On organisational supplied autonomy each 1% increase leads to 0.17% decrease of intrapreneurial behaviour ($\rho$ < 0.05).

Results from polynomial regression analysis is displayed in table [-@tbl:model-poly]. $R^2$ results suggest that both models account for significant variance. For both models low $R^2$ values are reported. As this study tests congruence hypothesis the values of $R^2$ are not informative. To test the hypothesis the pattern in the coefficients is crucial, which is not displayed by $R^2$ (Edwards, personal communication).

**Hypothesis 3** argues that psychological safety positively relates to intrapreneurial behaviour. An individual regression analysis for the relation between psychological safety and intrapreneurial behaviour has been run to test this hypothesis. It showed an insignificant effect of .05 ($\chi$<sup>2</sup> = 0.0006, F (267) = 0.154, $\rho$ < 0.695) for they daily measurements. Control tests with the nine-item IB construct in T1 yielded insignificant results as well. Both for the self-reported effect of .13 (($\chi$<sup>2</sup> = 0.0021, F (260) = 0.564, $\rho$ < 0.453) and the supervisor reported value of -.19 ($\chi$<sup>2</sup> = 0.0029, F (267) = 0.785, $\rho$ < 0.376). As such hypothesis 3 lacks evidence to be supported.

Hypothesis 1 argues that a fit of autonomy needed and supplied will lead to intrapreneurial behaviour. The opposite is argued by Hypothesis 2, which states that misfit relates to intrapreneurial behaviour. Response surface methodology [@edwards1993] was used to test these hypothesis. This methodology is centred around a two lines of interest. The line of congruence ($Y = X$) that represents the degree of fit between individual autonomy needs (X) and organisational supplied autonomy (Y) on the outcome of intrapreneurial behaviour (IB). The line of incongruence ($Y = -X$) displays the effect of misfit between individual needs and organisational supply.

@@ Jana, I have done a simple regression on IB ~ individual need and IB ~ org need. Both show significant relationships. Is it interesting to add these results here?

For better understanding of the surface modelling three-dimensional illustrations are supplied. Analysis for our main model is reported in table [-@tbl:surface-response] and illustrated in figure [-@fig:sra-main-model]. The results of the polynomial regression are evaluated with regard to four surface test values: $a1$, $a2$, $a3$, and $a4$. The first two test variables are centred around the line of perfect agreement between the two predictor variables. The latter two are centred around the line of incongruence. Where $a1$ and $a3$ are both concerned with the slope of each line, $a2$ and $a4$ evaluate the curvature of each corresponding line. Hypothesis 1 and hypothesis 2 are both concerned with the line of perfect agreement, as such the values of $a1$ and $a2$ are under scrutiny. Both values are insignificant. As such both **hypothesis 1** and **hypothesis 2** lack evidence to be supported.

For low psychological safety significant results where found for $a3$ and $a4$. The equations for the slope and curvature along the line of incongruence. The negative value of a4 shows that intrapreneurial behaviour declines more sharply as the discrepancy between needs and supplies increases. Figure [-@fig:sra-psy] shows that the negative consequence on intrapreneurial behaviour exists in situations of excess. Which is confirmed by the significant and positive value of a3. For high levels of psychological safety no significant results are found. Figure [-@fig:sra-psy] illustrates the response surface for high psychological safety.

Given these findings for both **hypothesis 4a** and **hypothesis 4b** no evidence could be found, given the lack of significant results for the high psychological safety.
