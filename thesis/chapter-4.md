## New hypothesis - for reference

1 A perceived needs-supplies (congruent) fit on autonomy will positively relate to intrapreneurial behaviour, resulting into an U-shape curve

2 A perceived needs-supplies (incongruent) misfit on autonomy will positively relate to intrapreneurial behaviour, resulting in an reversed U-shape curve

3 Psychological safety is positively related to intrapreneurial behaviour

4a The positive relation of needs-supplies fit on autonomy will be stronger when psychological safety is high then when it is low

4b The positive relation of needs-supplies misfit on autonomy will be stronger when psychological safety is high then when it is low

@@ think about adding a control variable here

The means, standard deviations, and zero-order correlations for our variables are presented in table [-@tbl:descriptives]. It shows significant relations between individual autonomy needed and autonomy supplied, and between both autonomy variables intrapreneurial behaviour. Means and standard deviations for all variables suggest considerable variations and little evidence of floor or ceiling effects.

For our control variables only a significant relation between psychological safety and education has found. As all other correlations are insignificant the control variables are ignored for further analysis of the data. Lastly, Big5 has been discarded due to low alpha's found for this construct. These low alpha's are a result from the limited number of questions asked for this construct.

Confirmatory factor analyses showed that the four-factor model in which the study variables were kept separate was a better fit to the data. The four-factor model ($\chi$<sup>2</sup> (98, N=269) = 401.566, $\rho$ < 0.001; comparative fit index (CFI) = .873; root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) = .107; standardised root mean square residual (SRMR) = .037) compared better then the one-factor model (x<sup>2</sup> (104, N=269) = 1443.527, $\rho$ < 0.001; CFI = .44; RMSEA = .219; SRMR = .17). An ANOVA test between the models showed a $\Delta\chi$<sup>2</sup> of 1042 with a $\rho$ < 0.001. The results of the four-factor model support the distinctiveness of the measures used in the study.

**Hypothesis 3** argues that psychological safety positively relates to intrapreneurial behaviour. This study has not found a significant relation that proves this hypothesis. As such hypothesis 3 should be rejected.

Contradictory the individual autonomy needs relate positively to intrapreneurial behaviour whereas supplied organisational autonomy relates negatively. This suggests that both needs and supply of autonomy has no congruent and incongruent effect [@@]. Multiple linear regression analysis ($\chi$<sup>2</sup> = 0.0423, F (266) = 5.874, $\rho$ < 0.01) confirms the contradictory findings. For every 1% increase in individual autonomy need an 0.24% increase of intrapreneurial behaviour is found ($\rho$ < 0.01). On organisational supplied autonomy each 1% increase leads to 0.17% decrease of intrapreneurial behaviour ($\rho$ < 0.05).

Results from polynomial regression analysis is displayed in table [-@tbl:model-poly]. $R^2$ results suggest that both models account for significant variance. For both models low $R^2$ values are reported. These low values indicate high variability in the collected data.

Hypotheses 1 argues that a fit of autonomy needed and supplied will lead to intrapreneurial behaviour. The opposite is argued by Hypothesis 2, which states that misfit relates to intrapreneurial behaviour. Response surface methodology [@edwards1993] was used to test these hypothesis. This methodology is centred around a two lines of interest. The line of congruence ($Y = X$) that represents the degree of fit between individual autonomy needs (X) and organisational supplied autonomy (Y) on the outcome of intrapreneurial behaviour (IB). The line of incongruence ($Y = -X$) displays the effect of misfit between individual needs and organisational supply.

For better understanding of the surface modelling three-dimensional illustrations are supplied. Analysis for our main model is reported in table [-@tbl:surface-response] and illustrated in figure [`@fig:sra-main-model]. For all 4 a's the main model yielded insignificant results. This suggests that a (mis)fit of autonomy on intrapreneurial behaviour - the interaction between N and S - is influenced by other factors. As such **hypothesis 1** and **hypothesis 2** should be rejected.

Hypothesis 4a and 4b seek to test out a moderating effect of psychological safety. Computation for the slope and curvature of the surface, across low and high levels of psychological safety, were compute by substituting values one standard deviation above and below the mean of intrapreneurial behaviour [@cohen2014]. Before computing these effects the values of psychological safety were standardised.

For low psychological safety significant results where found for _a3_ and _a4_. The equations for the slope and curvature along the line of incongruence. The negative value of a4 shows that intrapreneurial behaviour declines more sharply as the discrepancy between needs and supplies increases. Figure [-@fig:sra-psy] shows that the negative consequence on intrapreneurial behaviour exists in situations of excess. Which is confirmed by the significant and positive value of a3. For high levels of psychological safety no significant results are found. Figure [-@fig:sra-psy] illustrates the response surface for high psychological safety.

Given these findings both **hypothesis 4a** and **hypothesis 4b** should be rejected, given the lack of significant results for the high psychological safety.

## tl;dr on conclusions

Given these results we can conclude:

- Contradicting effects happen for autonomy needs and supply in regards to IB. This suggests that autonomy NS-fit on intrapreneurial behaviour is irrelevant, and has to be seen as two distinct variables
  - This claim is based on the lack of significance between N and S when they interact (NxS)
  - And it moving the opposite direction in case of 1% increases; e.g. it is interesting that IB decreases on an increase of org supply
  - @@ Jana; could above be explained by some weird outliers?
- The effect of autonomy (needs and supply) on intrapreneurial behaviour is clouded by effects not studied in these thesis
  - There is no direct relation between autonomy and IB, there are other/different constructs mediating/moderating between these two variables
  - This allows for opportunities to further research the moderating or mediating effects between autonomy and intrapreneurial behaviour
- In a low psychological safety environment supplying high levels of autonomy has a negative effect on individuals with low desire for autonomy
- A relation between psychological safety and IB has not been found in this study.
