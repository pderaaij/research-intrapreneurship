# 4. Results

## 4.1 Descriptive analysis

The means, standard deviations, and zero-order correlations for our variables are presented in table [-@tbl:descriptives]. For each variable the survey origin is added. These origins has been used for analysing the main model. Supplementary analysis has been held to control the results of the main model. This is reported in the last section of this chapter.

Table [-@tbl:descriptives] shows significant relations between individual autonomy needs and organisational autonomy supplied, and between both autonomy variables intrapreneurial behaviour. Means and standard deviations for all variables suggest considerable variations and little evidence of floor or ceiling effects. It is noteworthy that both variables are significantly related to intrapreneurial behaviour, but differ in direction. Polynomial regression analysis is particularly helpful in understanding what's happening here. For our control variables only a significant relation between psychological safety and education has found. As all other correlations are insignificant the control variables are ignored for further analysis of the data.

Confirmatory factor analyses showed that the four-factor model in which the study variables were kept separate was a better fit to the data. The four-factor model ($\chi$<sup>2</sup> (98, N=269) = 401.566, $\rho$ < 0.001; comparative fit index (CFI) = .873; root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) = .107; standardised root mean square residual (SRMR) = .037) compared better then the one-factor model ($\chi$<sup>2</sup> (104, N=269) = 1443.527, $\rho$ < 0.001; CFI = .44; RMSEA = .219; SRMR = .17). An ANOVA test between the models showed a $\Delta\chi$<sup>2</sup> of 1042 with a $\rho$ < 0.001. The results of the four-factor model support the distinctiveness of the measures used in the study.

## 4.2 Polynomial regression analysis & response surface modelling

Multiple linear regression analysis ($\chi$<sup>2</sup> = 0.0423, F (266) = 5.874, $\rho$ < 0.01) shows different behaviour for individual needs and organisational supply. For every 1% increase in individual autonomy need an 0.24% increase of intrapreneurial behaviour is found ($\rho$ < 0.01). On organisational supplied autonomy each 1% increase leads to 0.17% decrease of intrapreneurial behaviour ($\rho$ < 0.05). Polynomial regression analysis provides answers on the two predicting autonomy variables on the outcome of intrapreneurial behaviour.

Following the protocol established by Edwards [-@edwards1993] the polynomial regression analysis is executed in a multi-step approach. The first step represents our main model of the relationship between person (individual autonomy needs), environment (organisational autonomy supply), and outcome (intrapreneurial behaviour). The second step adds the interaction with psychological safety as moderator following procedures set by @vogel2016. Results from both polynomial regressions are displayed in table [-@tbl:model-poly]. $R^2$ results suggest that both models account for significant variance. For both models low $R^2$ values are reported. As this study tests congruence hypothesis the values of $R^2$ are not informative. To test our hypotheses the pattern in the coefficients is crucial, which is not displayed by $R^2$ (Edwards, personal communication).

For better understanding of the polynomial regressions the use of three-dimensional visualisations is recommended [@edwards1993, @shanock2010]. Analysis for our main model is illustrated in figure [-@fig:sra-main-model], figure [-@fig:sra-psy] shows the illustration for our moderated model. Each surface shows the effect of (in)congruence between needs and supply along the outcome of intrapreneurial behaviour. As such it allows for richer interpretation of the results. Central elements in the visualised surface are the line of perfect agreement and the line of incongruence. Perfect agreement, the $Y = X$ line, represents the situation that individual autonomy needs matches the organisational supplied autonomy. In other words, this represents autonomy fit. What happens left or right from the line of perfect fit shows the outcomes of misfit on intrapreneurial behaviour. The opposite situation is captured by the line of incongruence, the $Y = -X$ line. This represents the situations where individual need is opposite of organisational supply. As such it represents the relationship of perfect misfit (e.g. 7 on need and 1 on supply) on intrapreneurial behaviour. Complete incongruence is found in the left-top and right-bottom corner.

Important features of the surface are mathematically identified by four test values: $a1$, $a2$, $a3$, and $a4$ [@edwards1993]. The first two test variables are centred around the line of perfect agreement between the two predictor variables. The latter two are centred around the line of incongruence. Where $a1$ and $a3$ are both concerned with the slope of each line, $a2$ and $a4$ evaluate the curvature of each corresponding line. A significant positive value for a slope suggests that the outcome increases linearly as both predictors increase. A significant value for curvature tells something about the degree of discrepancy. High values for curvature indicates that divergence between the two predictors is of relevance in relationship to its outcome. For both our main model and moderating model the surface tests values are reported in table [-@tbl:surface-response].

## 4.3 Hypothesis testing

> Hypothesis 1: (a) Intrapreneurial behaviour will be lower when individual needs and organisational supply are both low and will be higher when both are high; (b) intrapreneurial behaviour will increase as organisational supply of autonomy increases towards individual autonomy need (fit), and will decrease as organisational supply exceeds individual need.

_Hypothesis 1:_ The premise of this hypothesis is that a fit of autonomy needs and supply is not only essential for intrapreneurial behaviour, but also will increase linearly as both need and supply increase (part a). Table [-@tbl:model-poly] shows the regression results for the main model. These results do not show any significant results for the individual terms or for the interaction of the terms. The three-dimensional response surface is illustrated in figure [-@fig:sra-main-model] and the corresponding test values are reported in table [-@tbl:surface-response].

For part a of this hypothesis particular interest lies in the value of $a1$ and $a2$ as they are focused on the line of perfect fit. A significant $a1$ would suggest a linear slope, whereas a significant $a2$ would suggest a non-linear slope. No significant result has been found for both values leading to a lack of evidence to support hypothesis 1a. Part b claims that reducing the deficiency of autonomy leads to higher levels of intrapreneurial behaviour. As autonomy becomes an excess it will leads to lower levels of intrapreneurial behaviour. This behaviour would be visualised as a concave (low edges; high middle) surface in the surface model. A significant negative test value of $a4$ would mathematically support this concave surface. The visualised surface response ([@fig:sra-main-model]) suggests differently, but as the test values $a3$ and $a4$ both yielded insignificant results no claim can be made. Thus, evidence lacks to support or contradict hypothesis 1b.

> Hypothesis 2: (a) Intrapreneurial behaviour will be lower when individual needs and organisational supply are both low or both high; (b) Intrapreneurial behaviour will increase when the difference between individual needs and organisational supply (misfit) increases.

_Hypothesis 2:_ Part a of this hypothesis suggests that perfect fit, both low and high, of autonomy would lead to low levels of intrapreneurial behaviour. If correct, the surface of the main model @fig:sra-main-model should illustrate a concave surface along the line of perfect fit. The test value of $a2$ ([@tbl:surface-response]) should be significant and negative to support the concave surface. As $a2$ has not yielded a significant result, evidence lacks to support hypothesis 2a.  
The b part of the hypothesis suggests that a degree of discrepancy between individual need and supply should exists. In the surface this should result into a convex (high edges; low middle) surface along the line of incongruence. The surface of our main model ([@fig:sra-main-model]) instead shows a concave surface and the test value of $a4$ ([@tbl:surface-response]) failed to reach significance. Consequently evidence lacks to support hypothesis 2b.

> Hypothesis 3: Psychological safety is positively related to intrapreneurial behaviour

_Hypothesis 3:_ This hypothesis argues that psychological safety positively relates to intrapreneurial behaviour. An individual regression analysis for the relation between psychological safety and intrapreneurial behaviour has been run to test this hypothesis. It showed an insignificant effect of .05 ($\chi$<sup>2</sup> = 0.0006, F (267) = 0.154, $\rho$ < 0.695) for they daily measurements. As such hypothesis 3 lacks evidence to be supported.

> Hypothesis 4a: The positive relation of needs-supplies fit on autonomy will be stronger when psychological safety is high then when it is low

> Hypothesis 4b: The positive relation of needs-supplies misfit on autonomy will be stronger when psychological safety is high then when it is low

_Hypothesis 4:_ Hypothesis 4a and 4b both suggest that high levels of psychological safety are beneficial, irrelevant if a (mis)fit of autonomy needs and supply exists. To test these hypothesis surface models ([@fig:sra-psy]) and surface test values ([@tbl:surface-response]) are calculated for both low and high levels of psychological safety. Only for low levels of psychological environment significant values were found. The significant negative value of $a4$ - the curvature test along line of incongruence - mathematically represents a concave surface as shown in the figure. The significant negative value of $a3$ represents the directionality of the discrepancy. Along the line of incongruence an excess (supply > need) of autonomy is impacting intrapreneurial behaviour more than a deficiency of autonomy.  
No significant results have been found for high psychological safe environments. As such comparing the low and high environments would not lead to meaningful insights. Resulting into a lack of evidence to support hypothesis 4a and 4b.

## 4.4 Supplementary analysis

The main analysis was not able to find a significant relation between psychological safety and intrapreneurial behaviour. This is tested by using the three-item construct of intrapreneurial behaviour. A construct with a relatively weak Cronbach's $\alpha$ of .65. The nine-item constructs used in both T1 surveys had higher reliability scores. Therefore control tests were run for psychological safety on the T1 survey of the team members and on that for the supervisors. Both yielded insignificant results as well. The self-reported found an effect of .13 (($\chi$<sup>2</sup> = 0.0021, F (260) = 0.564, $\rho$ < 0.453) and the supervisor survey reported a value of -.19 ($\chi$<sup>2</sup> = 0.0029, F (267) = 0.785, $\rho$ < 0.376). Contributing to the lack of evidence to support hypothesis 3.
