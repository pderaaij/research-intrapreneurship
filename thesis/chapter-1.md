# 1. Introduction

## 1.1 Background & context

In today's world, organisations need to stay ahead of their competition. To do so, they need to remain and gain a competitive advantage over their competition. Already in 1986 Tushman & Nadler stressed that “organisations can gain competitive advantage only by managing effectively for today while simultaneously creating innovation for tomorrow”. Innovativeness is a key differentiator for organisations to thrive in this competitive world. A pressing problem for managers is to ensure sustained innovation [@tushman1986]. Years later managers still tend to be myopic, untrained, or constrained by lack of experience [@braganza2009]. It is up to managers to ensure organisations innovate and cope with the changing environment.

A way for organisations to achieve sustained innovation is to promote intrapreneurship. Intrapreneurship is a bottom-up process of recognising and exploiting opportunities by being innovative, proactive and taking risks [@neessen2019; @gawke2019; @deJong2015; @elert2020]. It argues that intrapreneurial employees self-start initiatives. As it are these employees who are aware of external trends and events.

Intrapreneurial employees contribute to the competitive advantage of an organisation. Intrapreneurs are becoming an important factor to innovation and economic growth [@elert2020; @gawke2019]. To be an intrapreneur, employees should display different behaviours. According to @bowen2016 employees should not be passive recipients of changing jobs and products. They need to adapt to roles as innovators and differentiators. Adopting a more intrapreneurial way of working is required for employees. It allows them to deal with or even start changing requirements. As such, impacting the strategic direction of a firm [@peters1982].

## 1.2 Problem statement

In an organisation not all employees will behave as intrapreneurs. @neessen2019 stated, in their systematic literature review, that employee autonomy influences the intrapreneur. On that same note, @deJong2015 found that job autonomy relates to innovative and proactive behaviour. Both sub-dimensions of intrapreneurial behaviour. Underlying premise in the research of de Jong is that job autonomy is provided by the organisation. Yet, this is only part of the story. Although an environment provides a certain level of characteristics, it can be questionable whether this will engage the employee into certain behaviour. Autonomy, for example, can be given by an organisation, but some employees will thrive in it and others will be unhappy. It is generally assumed that a fit should exist between the characteristics desired by an employee and provided by an organisation [@vanVianen2018; @lambert2003].

An increase in autonomy has proved to be beneficial for subjective well-being and work efficiency. Still, it does have a tipping point. Both @zhou2020 and @stiglbauer2018 discovered a "too-much-of-a-good-thing" effect occurred when autonomy exceeded the threshold of an individual. Resulting into a sharp decrease in subjective well-being. Following the model of Job Demands-Resources, autonomy can be perceived as a resource for an individual or a demand. Many researches has looked into the various perspectives of job autonomy [@yu2016; @sorlie2022; @simmering2003; @jong2021]. Yet, no prior research has investigated the topic of autonomy (mis)fit and its influences on intrapreneurial behaviour. A gap in academic literature that this research attempts to fill.

Although people have an innate need to fit to their environment, a perfect fit seldom exists [@vanVianen2018]. Meaning that most individuals and organisations will experience misfit. Misfits are not necessarily bad. Experiencing misfit will lead individuals to adapt to their situation [@vanVianen2018]. Understanding the effect of adaptation, in the case of autonomy misfit, towards intrapreneurial behaviour can help organisations to influence intrapreneurship in their organisation.

Intrapreneurial behaviour is often measured on individual level. Yet, the act of getting intrapreneurial outcomes is often a team effort. Team members have to work and learn collaboratively to achieve desired outcomes [@edmondsonLei2014]. In times of uncertainty and collaboration, psychological safety has shown to enhance the performance of the team [@edmondsonLei2014; @frazier2017; @newman2017]. Psychological safety is a shared belief held by members of a team that the team is safe for interpersonal risk raking [@edmondson1999]. Teams with high levels of psychological safety take more risks, share more information, seek more feedback, and perform better. Having a positive influence on innovation, process improvements, knowledge creation, and successful technology implementations [@edmondson1999; @edmondsonLei2014; @frazier2017; @newman2017].

Both autonomy fit and misfit has shown to influence dimensions of intrapreneurial behaviour. @yu2016, for example, showed that autonomy misfit leads to higher levels of proactivity. In case of autonomy fit, psychological safety has influenced creativity, risk taking, and motivation to engage in learning [@choo2007]. Given these findings, psychological safety might influence the effects of autonomy (mis)fit in relation with intrapreneurial behaviour.

Summarising, autonomy has been researched as a contributing factor to intrapreneurship in various researches. Yet, none of these consider the personal needs for autonomy. Different forms of experienced misfits can have different effects on intrapreneurial behaviour. Additionally, a psychological safe team can moderate the effect of misfit on intrapreneurial behaviour. This study researches these various perspectives to raise answers and new questions.

## 1.3 Academic & practical relevance

In current academic literature not much is known about the relation and effects of autonomy (mis)fit, psychological safety, and intrapreneurial behaviour. Although the elements on their own have been subject of many researches, the trilogy of these elements have not been examined. The contribution of this research as such is multifold.

### 1.3.1 Academic relevance

The contribution of this paper to the academics is twofold. First, a recurring question in the field of intrapreneurship is the influence of teams on intrapreneurial behaviour [@neessen2019; @deJong2015]. The answers of this research contribute to the field by displaying if and how the team affects intrapreneurial behaviour of an individual. Specifically, if a psychological safe team environment acts as a catalyst or as a coping mechanism in the case of autonomy (mis)fit for the individual. Secondly, this also answers a question raised by @vanVianen2018: "which environmental and individual factors mitigate experienced misfits?". In the case of this research the question is if psychological safety mitigates the experienced autonomy misfit.

Polynomial regression analysis is used to not simply see fit or misfit binary. By using polynomial regression analysis and the accompanying surface response analysis the type of misfit can be determined. Misfit can be either an excess (having too much of it) or a deficiency (having too less of it). Prior research shows that excess misfit can have different outcomes then deficient misfts [@stiglbauer2018, @vogel2016].

### 1.3.2 Practical relevance

Organisations has shown to benefit from innovation and other means of gaining competitive advantage [@elert2020; @peters1982]. Ensuring sustained innovation is a pressing problem for managers [@tushman1986]. Attracting, retaining, and growing intrapreneurs in the organisation is a vivid question for organisation. This research aims to show whether or not autonomy (mis)fit and/or psychological safety is beneficial to increase intrapreneurial behaviour of employees. Especially for organisations that are active in the field of software development, the context of this research. These insights could lead to adoption of recruitment strategies by selecting adaptable minds that can cope with misfit between levels of needs and supplies of autonomy [@yu2016; @vanVianen2018].

Besides providing advice & insights to the attraction and selection of employees, this research tries to contribute to the field of job design. @deJong2015 already showed that job autonomy is an influencing factor to entrepreneurial behaviour. However, in that research employees are seen as an homogeneous group. This research attempts to complement that insight by acknowledging the personal needs of autonomy compared to what is supplied. This additional knowledge can help organisations to develop strategies and mechanisms to smartly design their jobs to promote and enhance intrapreneurship for different individuals.

## 1.4 Method of research

The study follows a quantitive design to analyse correlating effects between the variables. A diary study is the primary method to collect the data. Software development teams filled in a daily questionnaire for 10 consecutive working days. Prior to the daily surveys participants filled in a baseline (T0) survey. Following the dailies a reflective survey (T1) is filled in by participants and their supervisors. The resulting data is analysed using polynomial regression analysis and three dimensional surface response analysis.
