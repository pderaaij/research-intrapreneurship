# 1. Introduction

## 1.1 Background & context

In today's world organisations need to stay ahead of their competition. In order to do so they need to remain and gain a competitive advantage over their competition. @tushman1986 stressed that “organisations can gain competitive advantage only by managing effectively for today while simultaneously creating innovation for tomorrow” (p. 19). Being innovative is a key differentiator for organisation to thrive in this competitive world. A pressing problem for managers is to ensure sustained innovation [@tushman1986]. Employees in an organisation are increasingly required to be innovative and to contribute to the ever changing goals of the organisations. These intrapreneurs are more and more deemed as an important factor to innovation and economic growth [@elert2020; @gawke2019].

Intrapreneurs contribute to the competitive advantage of the organisation. Organisations uphold different expectations of their employees. @bowen2016 states that employees should not be passive recipients of changing jobs and products, they need to adopt roles as _innovators_ and _differentiators_. Adopting a more intrapreneurial way of working is required for employees to deal with or even initiate changing requirements and impact the strategic direction of a firm [@peters1982].

Organisations benefit from higher levels of intrapreneurship. Intrapreneurship is a process of recognising and exploiting opportunities by being innovative, proactive and taking risks [@neessen2019; @gawke2019; @deJong2015]. Rather then being driven from the top - like corporate entrepreneurship - intrapreneurship is a bottom-up multilevel construct [@neessen2019]. Being innovative, proactive, and risk-taking describe the behavioural dimensions of intrapreneurship [@neessen2019; @deJong2015]. @gawke2019 introduced three approached to intrapreneurship: 1) entrepreneurial orientation, 2) intrapreneurial outcomes approach, and 3) behaviour-based approach. The behaviours of innovativeness, proactivity, and risk-taking matches the entrepreneurial orientation.

## 1.2 Problem statement

In an organisation not all employees will behave as intrapreneurs. @neessen2019 stated in their systematic literature review that "employee autonomy is one of various dimensions that influence the intrapreneur. On that same note @deJong2015 found that _job autonomy_ is directly related to innovative and proactive behaviour. Underlying premise in the research of de Jong is that job autonomy is provided by the organisation. However, this is only part of the story. Although an environment provides a certain level of characteristics, it can be questionable whether this matches the needs of the employee. Autonomy, for example, can be given by an organisation, but some employees will thrive in it and other will be unhappy. A fit should exist between the characteristics desired by an employee and provided by an organisation. In this context of intrapreneurship and job autonomy we are looking specifically to _autonomy (mis)fit_.

Although people have an innate need to fit to their environment, a perfect fit seldomly exists [@vanVianen2018]. Meaning that most individuals and organisations will experience misfit. Misfits however are not necessarily bad as experiencing misfit will lead individuals to adapt to their situation [@vanVianen2018]. Understanding the effect of adaptation, in the case of autonomy misfit, towards intrapreneurial behaviour can help organisations to influence intrapreneurship in their organisation.

Regarding the topic of job autonomy many perspectives has been researched [@yu2016; @sorlie2022; @simmering2003; @jong2021]. However, no prior research has been done on the topic of autonomy (mis)fit and its influences on intrapreneurial behaviour. A gap in academic literature that this research attempts to fill.

Although intrapreneurial behaviour is often measured on individual level, the act of getting intrapreneurial outcomes is often a team effort. Members of the team have to work and learn collaboratively to achieve the desired outcomes [@edmondsonLei2014]. In times of uncertainty and collaboration, psychological safety has shown to enhance the performance of the team [@edmondsonLei2014]. Psychological safety is a shared belief held by members of a team that the team is safe for interpersonal risk raking [@edmondson1999]. Teams with high levels of psychological safety have shown to take more risk, share more information, seek more feedback, and perform better with regards to innovation, process improvements, knowledge creation, and successful technology implementations [@edmondson1999; @edmondsonLei2014; @frazier2017; @newman2017].

Both autonomy fit and misfit has shown to influence dimensions of intrapreneurial behaviour. @yu2016, for example, showed that autonomy misfit leads to higher levels of practivity. @destobbeleir2020 found a positive effect between psychological safety and feedback seeking. In case of autonomy fit, psychological safety has influenced creativity, risk taking, and motivation to engage in learning [@choo2007]. Given these findings, psychological safety might influence the effects of autonomy (mis)fit in relation with intrapreneurial behaviour.

Summarising, autonomy has been researched as a contributing factor to intrapreneurship in various researches. However, none of these take into the personal needs to autonomy in relation to what is supplied by the organisation. As perfect fit seldomly exists [@vanVianen2018], it is interesting to research what the effects are of autonomy (mis)fit on intrapreneurial behaviour. Potentially psychological safety can be found to moderate these effects.

## 1.3 Academic & practical relevance

In the current academic literature not much is known about the relation and effects of autonomy (mis)fit, psychological safety, and intrapreneurial behaviour. Although the elements on their own have been subject of many researches, the trilogy of these elements have not been examined. The contribution of this research as such is multifold.

### 1.3.1 Academic relevance

The contribution of this paper to the academics is twofold. First, a recurring question in the field of intrapreneurship is the influence of teams on intrapreneurial behaviour [@neessen2019; @deJong2015]. The answers of this research contribute to the field by displaying if and how the team affects intrapreneurial behaviour of an individual. Specifically, if a psychological safe team environment acts as a catalyst or as a coping mechanism in the case of autonomy (mis)fit for the individual. Secondly, this also answers a question raised by @vanVianen2018: "which environmental and individual factors mitigate experienced misfits?". In the case of this research the question is if psychological safety influences the experience autonomy misfit.

### 1.3.2 Practical relevance

Organisations has shown to benefit from innovation and other means of gaining competitive advantage [@elert2020; @peters1982]. Ensuring sustained innovation is a pressing problem for managers [@tushman1986]. Attracting, retaining, and growing intrapreneurs in the organisation is a vivid question for organisation. This research aims to show whether or not autonomy (mis)fit and/or psychological safety is beneficial to increase intrapreneurial behaviour of employees. Especially for organisations that are active in the field of software development, the context of this research. These insights could lead to adoption of recruitment strategies by selecting adaptable minds that can cope with misfit between levels of needs and supplies of autonomy [@yu2016; @vanVianen2018].

Besides providing insights to the attraction and selection of employees, this research tries to contribute to the field of job design. @deJong2015 already showed that job autonomy is an influencing factor to entrepreneurial behaviour. However, this research sees employees as an homogeneous group. This research attempts to complement that insight by acknowledging the personal needs of autonomy compared to what is supplied. This additional knowledge can help organisations to develop strategies and mechanisms to smartly design their jobs to promote intrapreneurship for different individuals.

## 1.4 Method of research

A quantitative study will be used to collect the data for this study. This data will be analysed using regression analysis.
