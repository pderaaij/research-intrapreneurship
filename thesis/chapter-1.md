# 1. Introduction

## 1.1 Background & context

In today's world organisations need to stay ahead of their competition. In order to do so they need to remain and gain a competitive advantage over their competition. @tushman1986 stressed that “organisations can gain competitive advantage only by managing effectively for today while simultaneously creating innovation for tomorrow” (p. 19). Being innovative is a key differentiator for organisation to thrive in this competitive world. A pressing problem for managers is to ensure sustained innovation [@tushman1986]. Employees in an organisation are increasingly required to be innovative and to contribute to the ever changing goals of the organisations. These intrapreneurs are more and more deemed as an important factor to innovation and economic growth [@elert2020; @gawke2019].

Intrapreneurs contribute to the competitive advantage of the organisation. Organisations uphold different expectations of their employees. @bowen2016 states that employees should not be passive recipients of changing jobs and products, they need to adopt roles as _innovators_ and _differentiators_. Adopting a more intrapreneurial way of working is required for employees to deal with or even initiate changing requirements and impact the strategic direction of a firm [@peters1982].

Organisations benefit from higher levels of intrapreneurship. Intrapreneurship is a process of recognising and exploiting opportunities by being innovative, proactive and taking risks [@neessen2019; @gawke2019; @deJong2015]. Rather then being driven from the top - like corporate entrepreneurship - intrapreneurship is a bottom-up multilevel construct [@neessen2019]. Being innovative, proactive, and risk-taking describe the behavioural dimensions of intrapreneurship [@neessen2019; @deJong2015]. @gawke2019 introduced three approached to intrapreneurship: 1) entrepreneurial orientation, 2) intrapreneurial outcomes approach, and 3) behaviour-based approach. The behaviours of innovativeness, proactivity, and risk-taking matches the entrepreneurial orientation.

## 1.2 Problem statement

In an organisation not all employees will behave as intrapreneurs. @neessen2019 stated in their systematic literature review that "employee autonomy is one of various dimensions that influence the intrapreneur. On that same note @deJong2015 found that _job autonomy_ is directly related to innovative and proactive behaviour. Underlying premise in the research of de Jong is that job autonomy is provided by the organisation. However, this is only part of the story. Although an environment provides a certain level of characteristics, it can be questionable whether this matches the needs of the employee. Autonomy, for example, can be given by an organisation, but some employees will thrive in it and other will be unhappy. A fit should exist between the characteristics desired by an employee and provided by an organisation. In this context of intrapreneurship and job autonomy we are looking specifically to _autonomy (mis)fit_.

Although people have an innate need to fit to their environment, a perfect fit seldomly exists [@vanVianen2018]. Meaning that most individuals and organisations will experience misfit. Misfits however are not necessarily bad as experiencing misfit will lead individuals to adapt to their situation [@vanVianen2018]. Understanding the effect of adaptation, in the case of autonomy misfit, towards intrapreneurial behaviour can help organisations to influence intrapreneurship in their organisation.

Regarding the topic of job autonomy many perspectives has been researched [@yu2016; @sorlie2022; @simmering2003; @jong2021]. However, no prior research has been done on the topic of autonomy (mis)fit and its influences on intrapreneurial behaviour. A gap in academic literature that this research attempts to fill.

- [ ] Je mist hier het brugje dat intrapreneurship vaak een team effort is en dat het vaak nodig is in het proces om bv met verschillende mensen te werken, etc. en dan pas moet je naar psy safe gaan. Want nu is dat wat een te grote sprong opnieuw

- Innovation and process improvements have been found at teams that have high levels of psychological safety [@edmondson1999; @edmondsonLei2014; @newman2017].
- Psychological safety is a shared belief held by members of a team that the team is safe for interpersonal risk taking [@edmondson1999].
- If a team feels safe, they will share more information and as such learn more then teams with lower levels of psychological safety [@edmondson1999; @newman2017].

## 1.3 Academic & practical relevance

In the current academic literature not much is known about the relation and effects of autonomy (mis)fit, psychological safety, and intrapreneurial behaviour. Although the elements on their own have been subject of many researches, the trilogy of these elements have not been examined. The contribution of this research as such is multifold.

### 1.3.1 Academic relevance

The contribution of this paper to the academics is threefold. First, a recurring question in the field of intrapreneurship is the influence of teams on intrapreneurial behaviour [@neessen2019; @deJong2015]. Secondly, @vanVianen2018 raised the question: "which environmental and individual factors mitigate experienced misfits?". This paper aims to shed a light on the question if psychological safety moderates an experienced misfit of autonomy. Lastly, not much is known about the relationship of the trilogy between autonomy misfit, psychological safety, and intrapreneurial behaviour.

### 1.3.2 Practical relevance

Organisations has shown to benefit from innovation and other means of gaining competitive advantage [@elert2020; @peters1982]. Ensuring sustained innovation is a pressing problem for managers [@tushman1986]. Attracting, retaining, and growing intrapreneurs in the organisation is a vivid question for organisation. This research aims to show whether or not autonomy (mis)fit and/or psychological safety is beneficial to increase intrapreneurial behaviour of employees. Especially for organisations that are active in the field of software development, the context of this research. These insights could lead to adoption of recruitment strategies by selecting adaptable minds that can cope with misfit between levels of needs and supplies of autonomy [@yu2016; @vanVianen2018].

Besides providing insights to the attraction and selection of employees, this research tries to contribute to the field of job design. @deJong2015 already showed that job autonomy is an influencing factor to entrepreneurial behaviour. However, this research sees employees as an homogeneous group. This research attempts to complement that insight by acknowledging the personal needs of autonomy compared to what is supplied. This additional knowledge can help organisations to develop strategies and mechanisms to smartly design their jobs to promote intrapreneurship for different individuals.

## 1.4 Method of research

Following a quantitative study this research will find an answer on its hypothesis....
