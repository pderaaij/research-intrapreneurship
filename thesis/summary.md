# Summary

Organisations need to gain and remain their competitive advantage over their competition. Innovation is a key differentiator for organisations to thrive in this world. Managers have a pressing problem to ensure sustained innovation [@tushman1986]. A way to achieve sustained innovation is thru intrapreneurship. Intrapreneurship is a bottom-up process of recognising and exploiting opportunities by being innovative, proactive, and taking risks [@neessen2019].

Not all employees in an organisation will behave as an intrapreneur. Intrapreneurial behaviour is influenced by many factors, including autonomy [@deJong2015]. Prior research investigated this relationship as autonomy being a design variable. The level of autonomy given by the organisation being the variable under study. However, that's only part of the story. Some people will thrive in an environment of autonomy, others will experience it as demanding. The relationship between individual autonomy need, organisational autonomy supply, and intrapreneurial behaviour is viewed thru the perspective of Person-Environment fit in this study.

Two prominent views exists in academic literature. The affective-consistency view argues that a fit should exists between individual needs and organisational supply. Only when both variables are congruent motivation will exist. Contradicting is the self-regulatory view. This view states a misfit is required between individual needs and organisational supply to get individuals motivated. Given the two contradicting views this research aims to provide insight if fit or misfit is required to promote intrapreneurship by influencing autonomy. Leading to the hypotheses:

- Hypothesis 1: (a) Intrapreneurial behaviour will be lower when individual needs and organisational supply are both low and will be higher when both are high; (b) intrapreneurial behaviour will increase as organisational supply of autonomy increases towards individual autonomy need (fit), and will decrease as organisational supply exceeds individual need.
- Hypothesis 2: (a) Intrapreneurial behaviour will be lower when individual needs and organisational supply are both low or both high; (b) Intrapreneurial behaviour will increase when the difference between individual needs and organisational supply (misfit) increases.

Most of today's work is accomplished as a team in collaboration [@edmondsonLei2014]. The way teams communicate, give feedback, and learn together have all been found to influence their performance. Prominent factor of influence in psychological safety. Psychological safety is the shared belief by members of the team that the team is safe for interpersonal risk-taking [@edmondson1999]. Teams with high levels of psychological safety do better on feedback seeking, sharing concerns, and learning in general. Potentially positively influencing intrapreneurial behaviour. Potentially, teams with high levels of psychological safety might perform better than teams with low safety. Leading to the hypotheses:

- Hypothesis 3: Psychological safety is positively related to intrapreneurial behaviour
- Hypothesis 4a: The positive relation of needs-supplies fit on autonomy will be stronger when psychological safety is high then when it is low
- Hypothesis 4b: The positive relation of needs-supplies misfit on autonomy will be stronger when psychological safety is high then when it is low

A diary study is used to collect data from software development teams. Using validated constructs participants entered a baseline survey, ten daily surveys, and a closing survey. The last survey is also entered by the supervisor of the team. Polynomial regression analysis and surface response modelling is used to test the hypotheses of above. For all of them no evidence is found to support or reject them.

Which view has the right perspective on promoting intrapreneurial behaviour via autonomy is still unclear. Analysis of the collected data showed peculiar behaviour in the relation between individual need for autonomy and organisational supply. Explanation of this can be found in the approach of measuring Person-Environment fit. Each approach might allow to measure different things. As such, the two views might not be contradicting, but rather complementing. Further research should combine these approaches in a single study to shed a light on this peculiarity.

No direct relationship between psychological safety and intrapreneurial behaviour has been found. However, in low psychological safe environments an excess of autonomy leads to lower levels of intrapreneurial behaviour. Meaning, an individual that feels unsafe and gets a lot of autonomy, will not take risks, be proactive, and innovate. Organisations should be aware of psychological safety in their teams.
