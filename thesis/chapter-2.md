# 2. Literature research

The theoretical framework of this study is centred around key concepts discussed in the problem statement. The definitions of these concepts are provided and explained using literature study. Figure [-@fig:research-framework] shows a visual model of this study.

## 2.1 What is intrapreneurship & intrapreneurial behaviour?

Intrapreneurship can be defined as “a process whereby employee(s) recognise and exploit opportunities by being innovative, proactive and by taking risks, in order for the organisation to create new products, processes and services, initiate self-renewal or venture new businesses to enhance the competitiveness and performance of the organisation [@neessen2019]”. In the academic literature "intrapreneurship" usually refers to individual workers rather than organisations or boardroom-level decision makers [@deJong2011]. This thesis adopts the point of view that intrapreneurship is a bottom-up approach [@deJong2011; @neessen2019]. Some literature uses intrapreneurship as a synonym for corporate entrepreneurship [@deJong2011]. However, both terms are distinct concepts. In line with @deJong2011 this thesis regards corporate entrepreneurship as a top-down process that can be used by business owners and general managers to foster new ventures, innovation, and strategic renewal.

Characteristically, intrapreneurship should be seen as a process. Intrapreneurship "is about a set of activities of an individual or an organisation to get from point A to point B in time, with an increased competitiveness and performance of the organisation as the end goal [@neessen2019]”. This definition shows that intrapreneurship is not simply a behaviour of an individual or an organisation, but is rather a complex construct of various activities. The framework makes a clear distinction between organisational and individual constructs. For example, the managerial support or organisational structure influences intrapreneurship. Attitudes and characteristics of individuals likewise influence intrapreneurship by impacting the behaviour of individuals. When individuals behave intrapreneurial, this behaviour will lead to outcomes such as new products or innovations, new business ventures, or self-renewal [@neessen2019].

The framework of @neessen2019 describes intrapreneurship as the sum of intrapreneurial behaviour and corporate entrepreneurship. The dimensions of intrapreneurial behaviours are defined as proactivity, innovativeness, risk-taking, opportunity recognition and exploitation, and networking. A review of @gawke2019 found three prominent conceptualisations of employee intrapreneurship in academic literature. Intrapreneurship can be seen as an employee's participation in an organisation's intrapreneurial pursuits (the intrapreneurial outcomes approach); the contribution of employee activities to strategic renewal and new ventures of an organisation (the behaviour-based approach); or as the employees' entrepreneurial orientation. This entrepreneurial orientation of employees is conceptualised as the tendency toward innovativeness, risk taking, and personal initiative. This last conceptualisation is commonly used in the literature to measure intrapreneurial behaviour [@deJong2011; @neessen2019; @gawke2019; @stam2012]. This research is primarily concerned with the behaviour of an individual and not the outcomes of that behaviour. Consequently, the conception of entrepreneurial orientation adopted is the viewpoint of @deJong2011 on intrapreneurial behaviour. De Jong et al. define intrapreneurial behaviour “as the identification and exploitation of opportunities by individual workers that (also) advance the organisation.”

## 2.2 The role of autonomy

Labour market conditions are changing. Rapid technological progress, increased employee tenures, a rise in high-skilled jobs, and requests for more flexibility all indicate an increased need for autonomy [@stiglbauer2018]. Companies are advised to grant employees a greater span of control in order to leverage digital technologies and employee's expertise [@mueckeHowDoesJob2019]. With autonomy becoming a more prominent component of work, the further investigation of its relationship with intrapreneurial behaviour is valuable.

Autonomy is an influencing factor for intrapreneurial behaviour [@neessen2019]. Giving employees the freedom to design their own work and make decisions results in more intrapreneurial activity and higher levels of self-efficacy [@neessen2019]. @deJong2015 similarly found that job autonomy leads to higher levels of intrapreneurial behaviour, especially with respect to its innovation and proactivity dimensions.

However, @gerards2021 states that the positive relation between autonomy and intrapreneurial behaviour is ambiguous. One stream states that autonomy has been shown to influence intrapreneurial behaviour through the mediating effect of a transformational leadership style [@gerards2021]. Another stream states that employees will be reluctant to show initiative when organisations and leaders emphasise efficiency and flawlessness, even when they are given autonomy [@jung2003; @yukl2001]. Additionally, both autonomy and innovative behaviour have shown meaningful variability on a daily basis [@zacher2014]. On days of perceived high autonomy employees are more likely to generate novel ideas, proactively tackle work-related problems and be more inclined to innovate [@ohly2009; @orth2017].

Much of the existing literature research autonomy from the provisioning aspect of an organisation [e.g., @deJong2015]. These studies see the relation between autonomy and intrapreneurial behaviour through the lens of job design [see @deJong2015; @rigtering2013; @gawke2019]. Although an organisation may offer autonomy, whether that autonomy will be used will depend on the individual. How individuals respond to high levels of autonomy strongly depends upon the individual and/or contextual characteristics [@stiglbauer2018]. Jong and Ford (2021) argue that it is critical to not only examine job autonomy on its own but to also examine the congruence between autonomy and the preference for autonomy. The Person-Environment theory offers a perspective for researching this congruence. Seen in simple terms, the needs and supply of autonomy can either fit or misfit.

Not all individuals will display the same behaviour, even when they are in the same environment. A popular theory explaining possible reasons for this difference is the Person-Environment fit theory. "Person-Environment fit is generally defined as the compatibility between individuals and their environment [@vanVianen2018]". The theory suggests that the attitudes, behaviours, and other outcomes, do not result from the person or environment separately, but rather from the relationship between the two [@jong2021]. In other words, if the characteristics of an individual are aligned with those of the environment, this will lead to a certain outcome in behaviour. The Person-Environment fit theory examines how job attitudes are explained by the fit between individuals and their work situation [@jong2021].

The key assumption of the Person-Environment fit theory is that people have an innate need to fit with their environments [@vanVianen2018]. Having a fit allows individuals to better understand the behaviours of others and facilitates interpersonal interactions. They compare themselves with other people in their social environment [@vanVianen2018]. Perfect fit, however, is a rare circumstance. People make suboptimal choices, and individuals and their environments change over time [@vanVianen2018]. A dominant model of Person-Environment fit theory is the attraction-selection-attrition (ASA) model from @schneider1987 [@simmering2003]. This model posits that employees are attracted to organisations that provide a high level of fit, are selected by organisations that recognise this fit, and leave the organisation when misfit occurs. This deemphasises the possibility that individuals might change themselves rather than leaving the organisation [@simmering2003]. Although individuals and organisations might strive for fit during attraction and selection, misfits research might provide organisations with more tangible advice and insight that helps them change their selection strategies or helps new hires adapt to their situation.

To answer the main hypothesis of this research, the fit concept of needs-supplies was chosen. Needs-supplies fit describes the alignment of the employee's needs, desires, or preferences and the supply provided by the job they perform [@kristof2005] The reason for this is twofold: 1) autonomy is typically researched in the context of person-job fit [@vanVianen2018], and 2) needs-supplies fit has the greatest impact on job attitudes [@kristof2005]. Regarding the effects of (mis)fit two opposing views predominate. The affective-consistency based view states that a needs-supplies fit gives rise to positive attitudes, which in turn acts as motivators [@yu2016]. The self-regulation view gives an opposing perspective. This view follows the core principle of cybernetics, namely that a negative feedback loop is required to get in motion [@edwards1992]. In other words, there must be a misfit in order to engage in certain behaviour. The research of Yu and Davis (2016) shows that a misfit of autonomy yields proactive behaviour at an individual, supporting the self-regulatory view.

### 2.2.1 The affective-consistency view

Prevalent idea of the affective-consistency based view is that a needs-supplies fit is required for one to be motivated [@yu2016]. This view posits that individual experiences of positive work-based emotions, will lead to a Person-Environment fit. The positive experience leads individuals to adjust or perceive that aspect so that a Person-Environment fit exists. Similarly, negative emotions lead a person to believe that a misfit exists [@yu2009]. A person perceives the right fit when they have been given the amount of autonomy that accords with their individual needs. The effect of perceiving this fit will positively influence the motivation of the individual. When an individual would like to have more or less autonomy than what their organisation gives them, they perceive a misfit. The misfit would negatively influence the motivation of the individual.

Many studies have implicitly or explicitly researched this affective-consistency based view. A fit between the autonomy needs and supplies can be viewed from the existing literature that treats autonomy from a job design perspective. Although the Person-Environment fit is not directly used in this existing research, it does display an underlying assumption that providing autonomy will lead to positive work experiences and as such enhance the perceived fit.

@deJong2015 found that job autonomy was directly related to the intrapreneurial dimensions of innovativeness and proactiveness. Job autonomy in this research influenced intrapreneurial behaviour. Job autonomy also affects job performance. Muecke and Iseke (2019) found that job autonomy leads to better performance as it enhances work motivation and reduces mental strain. In conjunction with high-quality leader-member exchange, job autonomy strengthens the effect of this exchange on creative work. In short, job autonomy has been found to have positive outcomes on a variety of perspectives. However, underlying all these positive outcomes is a fit between the autonomy needs and supplies. In other words, if an individual’s autonomy need fits the organisational supply, the individual will exhibit higher levels of intrapreneurial behaviour. Following the person-environment perspective, fit will show a linear effect on its outcome. When both person and environment are low, the outcome variable will be low. High levels for person and environment will lead to high levels for the outcome variable. For example, Jong and Ford (2021) found that work outcomes were at their highest levels only when the need and supply of autonomy both were high.

Nevertheless, the nature of this view discards the need for autonomy in contrast to the autonomy supplied by the organisation. @deJong2015 for example, already mentioned the limitation that highly intrapreneurial employees may be the ones that obtain high-autonomy functions. This limitation potentially skews it findings.

### 2.2.2 The self-regulatory view

The core principle of the self-regulating view is its focus on a negative feedback loop. This loop is essential to minimise differences between aspects of the environment and relevant reference criteria of the individual [@edwards1992]. The core premise is that a negative effects from an individual’s experience leads to the individual acting to improve their experience. @edwards1992 argues that an individual’s experience of stress has a negative effect on their well-being. This negative experience leads to an individual experiencing negative feelings that kickstart behaviour to improve their well-being, similar to how a thermostat triggers the boiler to reach a desired temperature by recognising when the temperature is not at a desired level.

Following the self-regulatory view, a perceived misfit of autonomy is required for individuals to change. @vanVianen2018 further states that an individual’s experience of misfit will lead to them adapting. Depending on the misfit perception, opportunities to repair the misfit, environmental and individual mitigating factors might motivate individuals to leave the job or adapt to the situation [@vanVianen2018]. The literature demonstrated powerful examples of beneficial misfits. For example, in a study that examines autonomy fit and personal development, @simmering2003 examined autonomy fit and personal development and found that autonomy misfit is essential for creating the impetus for an individual’s personal development. The autonomy misfit of newcomers has been shown to lead to higher levels of proactive behaviour [@yu2016]. These examples lend evidence to the self-regulatory view of needs-supplies misfit. Consequently, if misfit is required to motivate people, a needs-supplies fit will lead people to refrain from showing intrapreneurial behaviour or simply display less intrapreneurial behaviour.

The exact nature of misfit might yield to different outcomes. Misfit can either be an excess of supply or be a deficiency of what the individual needs. An individual can be affected by a lack of autonomy (deficiency) or be troubled due to an oversupply of autonomy (excess). Which type of misfit is experienced will determine the misfit’s impact. Additionally, @lambert2003 showed that not all experienced misfits are important for the individual. In other words, although a misfit may exist, it does not necessarily affect behaviour, attitudes, or outcomes.

Various studies argue that a linear relationship exists between the deficiency of autonomy and its impact on behaviour Stiglbauer and Kovacs (2018) showed that deficient misfit had a linear effect on well-being, meaning that any increase in fit leads to an equal improvement in well-being. Additionally, their research showed that a slight misfit deficiency actually fosters employee growth and well-being, confirming the self-regulatory view. In a study of employees’ online sharing of knowledge, the authors also found a linear effect on job autonomy [@pee2017].

It is believed that an excess of misfit will do less harm than a deficient misfit [@vanVianen2018]. The research of Yu and Davis (2016) investigated the level of proactivity of newcomers in an organisation, based on their personal needs for autonomy and what was supplied by the organisation. The authors found that an excess of autonomy misfit led to higher levels of proactivity compared to fit and deficient misfit. This result shows that, in the case of an excess misfit, meaning the organisation provided more autonomy than desired, individuals adapted more easily to the organisation [@yu2016].

A "too-much-of-a-good-thing" effect exist for autonomy. @zhou2020 discovered that giving too much autonomy to an individual has a tipping point. When exceeding that tipping point, too much autonomy was detrimental for the individual. Substantial levels of excess autonomy have been shown to decrease an individual's well-being [@stiglbauer2018]. @zhou2020 argues that an increase in autonomy leads to a depletion of job resources and consequently the subjective well-being of an individual will declines. An excess of autonomy therefore is unproblematic, but not indefinitely. At some point the individual will perceive the autonomy as a burden, and from that moment, autonomy negatively impacts intrapreneurial behaviour. The effect of excess autonomy on intrapreneurial behaviour is deemed to be curvilinear instead of linear.

In summary, the affective-consistency based view is centres around autonomy fit. Individual need and organisational supply must be aligned, so that positive emotions will positively influence intrapreneurial behaviour. Which leads to the first hypothesis:

> Hypothesis 1: (a) Intrapreneurial behaviour will be lower when individual autonomy need and organisational autonomy supply are both low and will be higher when both are high; (b) intrapreneurial behaviour will increase as the organisational supply of autonomy increases towards individual autonomy need (fit), and will decrease as organisational supply exceeds individual need.

The self-regulatory view assumes individual autonomy needs and organisational autonomy supply must be incongruent. Without this misfit, people will not adapt and behave intrapreneurial. This view leads to the second hypothesis:

> Hypothesis 2: (a) Intrapreneurial behaviour will be lower when individual autonomy need and organisational autonomy supply are both low or both high; (b) Intrapreneurial behaviour will increase when the difference between individual needs and organisational supply (misfit) increases.

## 2.3 Psychological safety

Today's businesses accomplishes much of their work through teamwork [@edmondsonLei2014; @newman2017; @frazier2017]. Rather than being individuals at work, multi-disciplined teams are working collectively to accomplish their goals. Product design, patient care, strategy development, and rescue operations are a few examples that call for collaborative work [@edmondsonLei2014]. The field of organisational research has identified psychological safety as an important factor in how people collaborate to achieve a shared outcome [@edmondsonLei2014].

Psychological safety refers to the shared belief among team members that the team is safe for interpersonal risk-taking [@edmondson1999; @edmondsonLei2014; @frazier2017; @newman2017]. Individuals that feel psychologically safe in a team will be less concerned with the way others might react when introducing a new idea or when voicing a concern. High levels of psychological safety have been linked to higher levels of creative thinking and risk-taking, innovation in R&D teams, process improvements in manufacturing, knowledge creation, and the successful implementation of technology [@newman2017]. @frazier2017 recognises that psychological safety is a key factor in facilitating the processes of learning, collaborating, and employee engagement.

The performance enabling role of psychological safety has consistently been found in numerous studies [@edmondsonLei2014]. Especially when organisational learning is important, psychological safety is as well [@edmondsonLei2014]. Much of today's organisational learning happens between the interactions of interdependent individuals. Individual's concerns about interpersonal risk or consequences could limit the learning behaviours of these individuals. High levels of psychological safety can reduce these concerns and as such contribute to organisational learning.

Psychological safety is both an individual-level and team level construct [@edmondsonLei2014; @frazier2017]. However, Edmondson and Lei (2014) argue that the group is the appropriate level for measuring psychological safety. In their systematic review they state: "Starting with Edmondson (1999), studies have found statistically significant variance in psychological safety between groups within organisations; that is, people working closely together tend to have similar perceptions of psychological safety, which vary across groups within the same organisation. This body of work thereby supports the idea that psychological safety in organisational life can best be considered a phenomenon that lives at the group level.".

## 2.4 Psychological safety impacting intrapreneurial behaviour

Individual elements of the intrapreneurial behaviour construct have been linked to psychological safety. Risk-taking, for example, is enhanced by psychological safety [@edmondson1999; @newman2017]. Likewise, creative thinking, innovation, and process improvements are outcomes of teams with a high level of psychological safety [@newman2017]. Team members in a psychologically safe climate were found to share more information, share suggestions for organisational improvements, and take initiative in developing new products and services [@edmondsonLei2014].

@deStobbeleir2020 discovered that in psychologically safe teams, members engage in feedback seeking. This type of feedback seeking can be labelled as "relational proactivity", and it aligns well with the networking dimension of intrapreneurial behaviour. Feedback seeking positively contributes to experimentation and learning. Psychological safety is strongly related to team learning and performance in environments that benefit from learning [@sanner2015]. An appropriate culture that allows for experimentations, feedback, and learning by trial and error is one of the two aspects needed to realise intrapreneurial potential [@gawke2019]. The other aspect is proactivity.

Psychological safety has been found to effect components of intrapreneurial behaviour and intrapreneurial outcomes as described in the framework of @neessen2019. Given the impact of psychological safety on components of intrapreneurial behaviour, the authors hypothesise that a relation exists between psychological safety and the complete construct of intrapreneurial behaviour exists. As far as the author knows, there has not been any distinctive research linking psychological safety to the complete construct of intrapreneurial behaviour.

> Hypothesis 3: Psychological safety is positively related to intrapreneurial behaviour

## 2.5 Psychological safety influences the effects of autonomy misfit

Achieving intrapreneurial outcomes, such as new products or self-renewal, does not arise from individual effort, but rather they are achieved through team effort. Today’s work is mostly accomplished in collaboration [@edmondsonLei2014; @newman2017; @frazier2017]. Therefore, the effects of an autonomy misfit on a team member can be influenced by others on the team. As individuals work in teams, the reactions of team members toward one another potentially impacts member attitudes about their work. Consequently, an individual’s team can influence their intrapreneurial behaviour. @neessen2019 called for further research regarding whether the psychological safety of a team influences the intrapreneurial behaviour of team members.

\newpage

Moderating effects of psychological safety has been proven extensively in the literature. In their systematic literature review, @newman2017 summarised how psychological safety weakens the negative relationship between role conceptualisation and achievement orientation, how expertise diversity influences team performance, and the relationship between process innovativeness and profitability. The moderating effect of psychological safety has been found on individual, team, and organisational levels. This prior research suggests that psychological safety has a potential moderating effect on the relationship between autonomy (mis)fit and intrapreneurial behaviour.

### 2.5.1 Psychological safety in the affective-consistency view

Following the job design perspective that autonomy fit leads to more intrapreneurial behaviour [@deJong2015] and better performance [@mueckeHowDoesJob2019], one can hypothesise that psychological safety will have a positive influence on the intrapreneurial behaviour of team members with autonomy fit. Psychological safety has proven to have a positive effect on the learning behaviour of teams [@edmondson1999; @edmondsonLei2014; @frazier2017]. @edmondson1999 describes learning behaviour as "learning at the group level of analysis as an ongoing process of reflection and action, characterised by asking questions, seeking feedback, experimenting, reflecting on results, and discussing errors or unexpected outcomes of actions". These behaviours are positively related with team performance [@edmondson1999; @edmondsonLei2014; @frazier2017]. @choo2007 found that psychological safety influenced creativity, divergent thinking, risk-taking, and motivated engagement in learning, all of which increase team performance. Additionally, @frazier2017, found that work design characteristics (including autonomy) positively influence psychological safety.

The premise of the affective-consistency based view is that positive work experience leads to perceived fit by the individual [@yu2009]. Consequently, it is likely that a psychologically safe team would have positive work experiences, resulting in a team that perceives a needs-supplies fit for autonomy. Thus, one can hypothesise that according to the affective-consistency based view, intrapreneurial behaviour is stronger in environments with high psychological safety.

> Hypothesis 4a: The positive relation of needs-supplies fit on autonomy will be stronger when psychological safety is high compared to when it is low

### 2.5.2 Psychological safety in the self-regulatory view

A negative experience is required with the self-regulatory view if individuals are to act. Proponents of this view argue that needs-supplies misfit is required to ignite the negative feedback loop. Consequently, fit will not trigger any feedback loop, and people will not act differently.

An excess of misfit has been shown to lead individuals to adapt to a given situation. Yu and Davis (2016) discovered that an excess of misfit leads to higher levels of proactive behaviour by an individual. Ashford and Black (1996) identified seven key types of change-oriented proactive behaviours: feedback seeking, information seeking, job change negotiation, positive framing, general socialising, building relationships with the boss, and networking. Information seeking and feedback seeking have especially been found to be influenced by psychological safety [@vanVianen2018; @deStobbeleir2020]. Feedback seeking may help individuals to cope with the misfit of autonomy [@vanVianen2018]. Teams with high levels of psychological safety ensure that information will be sought within the team, whereas in teams with low levels of psychological safety information will be sought outside the team [@safdar2017; @deStobbeleir2020].

According to the self-regulatory view, an excess of autonomy will give individuals the impetus to engage in intrapreneurial behaviour. Given that an excess of autonomy misfit leads to higher levels of proactivity, proactivity being a key behavioural dimension of intrapreneurship, and acknowledging the existing literature on the influencing effect psychological safety has on proactivity.

Additionally, Yu and Davis (2016) showed that a deficiency of misfit also yields to proactive behaviour, although less than what happens with excess misfit. The authors do not provide a clarification for this difference. A possible explanation can be found in the findings of @lambert2003. They found that deficient misfit leads to greater job dissatisfaction for specific inducements. Work dissatisfaction has been found to lead to creativity [@zhou2001], Likewise, @vanVianen2018 noted that “Seeking feedback may help individuals to better cope with misfit by putting effort into learning or adjusting to the job demands.”

> Hypothesis 4b: The positive relation of needs-supplies misfit on autonomy will be stronger when psychological safety is high compared to when it is low
