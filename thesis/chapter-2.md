## 2.1 What is intrapreneurship & intrapreneurial behaviour?

“Intrapreneurship is a process whereby employee(s) recognise and exploit opportunities by being innovative, proactive and by taking risks, in order for the organisation to create new products, processes and services, initiate self-renewal or venture new businesses to enhance the competitiveness and performance of the organisation.” [@neessen2019, p. 7]. In academic literature "intrapreneurship" usually refers to individual workers rather than organisations or boardroom-level decision makers [@deJong2011]. This paper adopts this points of view that intrapreneurship is a bottom-up approach [@deJong2011; @neessen2019]. A common label of intrapreneurship is _corporate entrepreneurship_ [@deJong2011]. In line with @deJong2011 this paper regards corporate entrepreneurship as a top-down process that can be used by business owners and general manages to foster new ventures, innovation, and strategic renewal [@deJong2011].

Intrapreneurship is not an attitude or a behaviour that an employee has, it has to be seen as a process. Rather it "is about a set of activities of an individual or an organisation to get from point A to point B in time, with an increased competitiveness and performance of the organisation as the end goal.” [@neessen2019, p. 8]. @neessen2019 created an integrative framework of intrapreneurship ([@fig:intrapreneurship-framework]) that displays the various constructs that together constitute intrapreneurship. The framework makes a clear distinction between organisational and individual constructs. For example the support of management or how the organisation is structured influences intrapreneurship on the organisation. Attitudes and characteristics of individuals likewise influence intrapreneurship by impacting the behaviour of individuals. When individuals behave intrapreneurially it will lead to outcomes as new product / innovation, new business venturing, or self-renewal [@neessen2019].

@deJong2011 describes _intrapreneurial behaviour_ "as the identification and exploitation of opportunities by individual workers that (also) advance the organisation. (p. 4)". Intrapreneurial behaviour is commonly defined by the dimensions of _proactivity_, _innovativeness_, and _risk-taking_ [@neessen2019, @deJong2011, @gawke2019]. Additionally @neessen2019 found _opportunity recognition and exploitation_ and _networking_ to be characteristic dimensions of intrapreneurial behaviour. @gawke2019 depicts this as an entrepreneurial orientation towards intrapreneurship.

As intrapreneurship is a bottom-up approach it can only be achieved if employees display intrapreneurial behaviour. Predicting if an individual will engage in certain human behaviour is a core tenet of the person-environment fit theory [@vanVianen2018]. It researches, and emphasises, the compatibility between workers and their work environment [@kristof1996]. The theory of person-environment fit suggests that individual attitudes, behaviours, and other outcomes result not from the person or environment separately, but from the relationship between the two [@edwards1996].

## 2.2 Person-environment fit perspective

Not all individuals will display the same behaviour, even when they are in the same environment. To find possible reasons for this difference academics use the theory of Person-Environment fit. "Person-Environment fit is generally defined as the compatibility between individuals and their environment [@vanVianen2018, p. 76]". The theory suggests that the attitudes, behaviours, and other outcomes, do not result from the person or environment separately, but rather from the relationship between the two [@jong2021].

@@ needs-supplies and why?

- A needs-supplies fit displays the alignment of the employees needs, desires, or preferences and the supply provided by the job the perform [@kristof2005]
- The needs-supplies will help us in determining if the NS fit or misfit on the organisational factor of autonomy [@neessen2019] will influence intrapreneurial behaviour.

## 2.3 The role of autonomy

Labor market conditions are changing. Rapid technological progress, increased employee tenure, a rise in high-skilled job, and request for more flexibility all indicate an increased need for autonomy [@stiglbauer2018]. Companies are advised to grant employees a greater span of control in order to leverage digital technologies and employee's expertise [@mueckeHowDoesJob2019]. As autonomy is becoming a more prominent work characteristic it can be of value to further investigate its relationship with intrapreneurial behaviour.

Autonomy is an influencing factor for intrapreneurial behaviour [@neessen2019]. Giving employees the freedom to design its own work and make decisions results into more intrapreneurial activities and higher levels of _self-efficacy_ [@neessen2019]. On that same note @deJong2015 found that job autonomy leads to higher levels of intrapreneurial behaviour, especially on its innovation and proactivity dimensions.

Research on intrapreneurship and job autonomy exists [e.g. @deJong2015]. Much of existing literature however has focussed on autonomy as something provided by the organisation. Like a component of job design. @jong2021 argues however that it is critical to no only examine job autonomy on its own, but to examine the congruence between autonomy and preference for autonomy. Applying a needs-supplies perspective provides a framework to examine this congruence.

### 2.3.1 When needs & supplies of autonomy are a fit

### 2.3.2 Needs and supplies are not always aligned

The needs of an employee regarding autonomy is not always matched by organisations. In these cases PE-fit literature speaks of a misfit. Experiencing misfit as an individual will lead to adaptation [@vanVianen2018]. Depending on the misfit perception, opportunities to repair the misfit, and environmental and individual mitigating factors it might motivate individuals to leave the job or adapt to the situation [@vanVianen2018].

@yu2016, for example, discovered that an autonomy misfit leads to higher levels of proactive behaviour at newcomers. On that same note, @simmering2003, found that autonomy misfit leads to higher engagement in employee development.

The exact nature of misfit might yield to different outcomes. Misfit can either due to an excess of supply or due to a deficiency between needs and supplies. Which type of misfit experiences will make a difference on their impact [@lambert2003; @yu2016]. Additionally @lambert2003 showed that not all experienced misfits is of importance for the individual.

In the case of autonomy misfit @yu2016 discovered that a misfit due to a higher supply of autonomy then needed, leads to higher levels of proactive behaviour. Proactive behaviour being one of the key dimensions of intrapreneurial behaviour [@neessen2019].

Summarising, autonomy is an influencing organisational factor to stimulate intrapreneurial behaviour [@neessen2019]. Autonomy misfit has proven to contribute to dimensions of intrapreneurial behaviour. As such I hypothesise that a misfit of the needs-supplies regarding autonomy will positively influence intrapreneurial behaviour.

> Hypothesis 1: Autonomy misfit is positively related to intrapreneurial behaviour

- @kristof2005 also showed that “in almost every case the complementary form of needs–supplies fit has the greatest impact on “individual attitudes and behavior” (Kristof-Brown et al., 2005, pp. 317 - 318). Which also suggest that in this case an effect on intrapreneurial behaviour will exists.

## 2.4 Psychological safety

Today's business environment accomplishes much of its work in collaboration [@edmondsonLei2014; @newman2017; @frazier2017]. Rather then individuals at work, multi-disciplined teams are working collectively towards their goals.

Organisational research has identified psyschological safety as an important factor in how people collaborate [@edmondsonLei2014].

- @frazier2017 recognises that psychological safety is a key factor in facilitating the process of learning, collaborating, and employee enagement
- Psychological safety is the shared belief by members of the team that the team is safe for interpersonal risk-0taking [@edmondson1999; @edmondsonLei2014; @frazier2017; @newman2017]
- High levels of psychological safety has been linked to higher levels of creative thinking and risk-taking, innovation in R&D teams, process improvements in manufacturing, knowledge creation, and successful implementation of technology [@newman2017]

**Relevance to intrapreneurial behaviour**:

- Higher levels of psychological safety enhances risk-taking, information sharing and learning behaviour of members from the team [@edmondson1999; @newman2017]
- Risk-taking is an intrapreneurial behaviour in the nomological network of @neessen2019
- The outcomes and characteristics of psychological safety can be expected to have a relation with each other, as such I hypothesise:

> Hypothesis 2: Psychological safety is positively related to intrapreneurial behaviour

- Given that higher levels of proactiveness is present in case of a misfit on autonomy level, I hypothesise that higher levels of proactiveness, reached due to psychological safety will positively influence the intrapreneurial behaviour

## 2.5 Autonomy misfit, proactive behaviour & psychological safety

- @yu2016 & @simmering2003 identified that an autonomy misfit leads to higher levels of proactive behaviour.
- @ashford1996 identified seven key types of change-oriented proactive behaviours:
  - feedback seeking; information seeking; job change negotiation; positive framing; general socialising; building relationships with the boss; and networking
- From these behaviours information seeking and feedback seeking have been found to be moderated by psychological safety
- @destobbeleir2020 showed that higher levels of psychological safety increases the amount of feedback seeking
- feedback seeking may be beneficial for individuals to cope with the misfit of autonomy [@vanVianen2018]
- High levels of psychological safety has shown that information will be sought within the team, where lower levels of psychological safety will lead to information seeking outside the team [@safdar2017]
- These forms of proactive behaviours all embed a form of risk-taking. It requires confidence and trust to engage in voice behaviour and start to ask for feedback and information.
- As higher levels of psychological safety reduces the barrier to engage in proactive behaviours I hypothesise that the level of psychological safety will influence the effect of autonomy misfit towards intrapreneurial behaviour
- Meaning that high levels of autonomy misfit and high levels of psychological safety will lead to higher levels of psychological safety.

> Hypothesis 3: Psychological safety moderates the positive effect of autonomy misfit towards intrapreneurial behaviour
