## 2.1 What is intrapreneurship

“Intrapreneurship is a process whereby employee(s) recognise and exploit opportunities by being innovative, proactive and by taking risks, in order for the organisation to create new products, processes and services, initiate self-renewal or venture new businesses to enhance the competitiveness and performance of the organisation.” [@neessen2019, p. 7]. In academic literature "intrapreneurship" usually refers to individual workers rather than organisations or boardroom-level decision makers [@deJong2011]. This paper adopts this points of view that intrapreneurship is a bottom-up approach [@deJong2011; @neessen2019]. A common label of intrapreneurship is _corporate entrepreneurship_ [@deJong2011]. In line with @deJong2011 this paper regards corporate entrepreneurship as a top-down process that can be used by business owners and general manages to foster new ventures, innovation, and strategic renewal [@deJong2011].

Intrapreneurship is not an attitude or a behaviour that an employee has, it has to be seen as a process. Rather it "is about a set of activities of an individual or an organisation to get from point A to point B in time, with an increased competitiveness and performance of the organisation as the end goal.” [@neessen2019, p. 8]. @neessen2019 created an integrative framework of intrapreneurship ([@fig:intrapreneurship-framework]) that displays the various constructs that together constitute intrapreneurship. The framework makes a clear distinction between organisational and individual constructs. For example the support of management or how the organisation is structured influences intrapreneurship on the organisation. Attitudes and characteristics of individuals likewise influence intrapreneurship by impacting the behaviour of individuals. When individuals behave intrapreneurially it will lead to outcomes as new product / innovation, new business venturing, or self-renewal [@neessen2019].

- [ ] Let hier ook op mijn comment van eerder ivm verschillende definties en focus op die van De Jong
- [ ] Ik vind dit stuk persoonlijk relatief kort. Meestal zetten studenten er nog een stukje bij rond antecedenten oid, gewoon om een beetje een beeld te geven van de literatuur en wat er al geweten is. Dit is geen harde eis en hoeft niet perse. Als je het wel doet hoeft het ook niet super lang te zijn. Zorg dat het dan bv. eerder als een soort van intro kan leiden voor de link met PEfit en/of NS fit. Door bv. uit te leggen dat er zowel persoonlijke factoren als organisatiefactoren zijn die relevant zijn voor de ontwikkeling van IB. en dan zou ik 2.2 vooral focussen op PE fit en daar hoeft dan (buiten 1 bindzinnetje als allereerste ofzo) nog niet echt de link met intra gemaakt te worden

## 2.2 Introducing intrapreneurial behaviour & person-environment fit

@deJong2011 describes _intrapreneurial behaviour_ "as the identification and exploitation of opportunities by individual workers that (also) advance the organisation. (p. 4)". Intrapreneurial behaviour is commonly defined by the dimensions of _proactivity_, _innovativeness_, and _risk-taking_ [@neessen2019, @deJong2011, @gawke2019]. Additionally @neessen2019 found _opportunity recognition and exploitation_ and _networking_ to be characteristic dimensions of intrapreneurial behaviour. @gawke2019 depicts this as an entrepreneurial orientation towards intrapreneurship.

As intrapreneurship is a bottom-up approach it can only be achieved if employees display intrapreneurial behaviour. Predicting if an individual will engage in certain human behaviour is a core tenet of the person-environment fit theory [@vanVianen2018]. It researches, and emphasises, the compatibility between workers and their work environment [@kristof1996]. The theory of person-environment fit suggests that individual attitudes, behaviours, and other outcomes result not from the person or environment separately, but from the relationship between the two [@edwards1996].

- [ ] Als je effectief start vanuit PE fit ipv meteen naar NS fit over te gaan dan zou ik hier vooral focussen op wat uitleg geven op wat PE fit exact is, wat fit en misfit is en wat alle verschillende soorten fit zijn. Dat ontbreekt nu allemaal nog wat. Alternatief laat je dit stuk gewoon integraal weg en ga je meteen door naar 2.3

  - Indien je dit stuk wel laat staan zal je wel gaan moeten verantwoorden waarom je in je scriptie uiteindelijk focust op NS fit ipv op alle andere concepten die mogelijk zijn binnen de fit context

- A needs-supplies fit displays the alignment of the employees needs, desires, or preferences and the supply provided by the job the perform [@kristof2005]
- The needs-supplies will help us in determining if the NS fit or misfit on the organisational factor of autonomy [@neessen2019] will influence intrapreneurial behaviour.

## 2.3 Autonomy misfit

- Generally a fit between person and their environment is desired to reach the optimal outcome, however the field of P-E fit argues for a nuanced perspective.
- @vanVianen2018 displayed in her in review study that experiencing misfit will lead to adaptation. Depending on the misfit perception, opportunities to repair the misfit, and environmental and individual mitigating factors it might motivate individuals to leave the job or to adapt to the situation.
- For example @yu2016 discovered that the mismatch between the levels of autonomy desired by an employee and the autonomy provided has been found to lead to higher levels of proactive behaviour at newcomers
- > This finding originates from the self-regulatory view that argues that newcomer behaviours are highest when there is a misfit between the organisational supply of autonomy and the needs of the individual [@yu2016].
- On that same note @simmering2003 found that autonomy misfit for an individual leads to higher engagement in employee development. Surprisingly this holds true for individuals with low levels of autonomy, but high levels of autonomy as well [@simmering2003].
- Although the research of @yu2016 and @simmering2003 are primarily focused on newcomers, @simmering2003 suggests that established employees could use the same strategies as newcomers to improve their fit levels.

- @neessen2019 determined autonomy as an important organisational factor contributing to intrapreneurial behaviour. @jong2021 argues that it is critical not to only examine the job autonomy on its own, but to examine the congruence between autonomy and preference for autonomy.
- Examining the needs-supplies fit of autonomy as such will provide a clearer picture on the effect of autonomy as contributing factor to intrapreneurial behaviour.
- @kristof2005 also showed that “in almost every case the complementary form of needs–supplies fit has the greatest impact on “individual attitudes and behavior” (Kristof-Brown et al., 2005, pp. 317 - 318). Which also suggest that in this case an effect on intrapreneurial behaviour will exists.

- As such I hypothesise that a misfit of the needs-supplies regarding autonomy will positively influence intrapreneurial behaviour.

> Hypothesis 1: Autonomy misfit is positively related to intrapreneurial behaviour

## 2.4 Psychological safety

- The business environment of today accomplishes much work in collaboration [@edmondsonLei2014; @newman2017; @frazier2017]
- Organisational research has identified psychological safety as an important factor in understanding how people collaborate [@edmondsonLei2014]
- @frazier2017 recognises that psychological safety is a key factor in facilitating the process of learning, collaborating, and employee enagement
- Psychological safety is the shared belief by members of the team that the team is safe for interpersonal risk-0taking [@edmondson1999; @edmondsonLei2014; @frazier2017; @newman2017]
- High levels of psychological safety has been linked to higher levels of creative thinking and risk-taking, innovation in R&D teams, process improvements in manufacturing, knowledge creation, and successful implementation of technology [@newman2017]

**Relevance to intrapreneurial behaviour**:

- Higher levels of psychological safety enhances risk-taking, information sharing and learning behaviour of members from the team [@edmondson1999; @newman2017]
- Risk-taking is an intrapreneurial behaviour in the nomological network of @neessen2019
- The outcomes and characteristics of psychological safety can be expected to have a relation with each other, as such I hypothesise:

> Hypothesis 2: Psychological safety is positively related to intrapreneurial behaviour

- Given that higher levels of proactiveness is present in case of a misfit on autonomy level, I hypothesise that higher levels of proactiveness, reached due to psychological safety will positively influence the intrapreneurial behaviour

## 2.5 Autonomy misfit, proactive behaviour & psychological safety

- @yu2016 & @simmering2003 identified that an autonomy misfit leads to higher levels of proactive behaviour.
- @ashford1996 identified seven key types of change-oriented proactive behaviours:
  - feedback seeking; information seeking; job change negotiation; positive framing; general socialising; building relationships with the boss; and networking
- From these behaviours information seeking and feedback seeking have been found to be moderated by psychological safety
- @destobbeleir2020 showed that higher levels of psychological safety increases the amount of feedback seeking
- feedback seeking may be beneficial for individuals to cope with the misfit of autonomy [@vanVianen2018]
- High levels of psychological safety has shown that information will be sought within the team, where lower levels of psychological safety will lead to information seeking outside the team [@safdar2017]
- These forms of proactive behaviours all embed a form of risk-taking. It requires confidence and trust to engage in voice behaviour and start to ask for feedback and information.
- As higher levels of psychological safety reduces the barrier to engage in proactive behaviours I hypothesise that the level of psychological safety will influence the effect of autonomy misfit towards intrapreneurial behaviour
- Meaning that high levels of autonomy misfit and high levels of psychological safety will lead to higher levels of psychological safety.

> Hypothesis 3: Psychological safety moderates the positive effect of autonomy misfit towards intrapreneurial behaviour
