## 2.1 What is intrapreneurship & intrapreneurial behaviour?

“Intrapreneurship is a process whereby employee(s) recognise and exploit opportunities by being innovative, proactive and by taking risks, in order for the organisation to create new products, processes and services, initiate self-renewal or venture new businesses to enhance the competitiveness and performance of the organisation [@neessen2019]”. In academic literature "intrapreneurship" usually refers to individual workers rather than organisations or boardroom-level decision makers [@deJong2011]. This thesis adopts this points of view that intrapreneurship is a bottom-up approach [@deJong2011; @neessen2019]. A common label of intrapreneurship is corporate entrepreneurship [@deJong2011]. In line with @deJong2011 this thesis regards corporate entrepreneurship as a top-down process that can be used by business owners and general manages to foster new ventures, innovation, and strategic renewal [@deJong2011].

Characteristically intrapreneurship should be seen as a process. Intrapreneurship "is about a set of activities of an individual or an organisation to get from point A to point B in time, with an increased competitiveness and performance of the organisation as the end goal [@neessen2019]”. This definition shows that intrapreneurship is not simply a behaviour of an individual or an organisation, but rather a complex construct of various activities. The complexity of this construct is shown in an integrative framework of intrapreneurship as created by @neessen2019 ([@fig:intrapreneurship-framework]) that displays the various constructs that together constitute intrapreneurship. The framework makes a clear distinction between organisational and individual constructs. For example the support of management or how the organisation is structured influences intrapreneurship in the organisation. Attitudes and characteristics of individuals likewise influence intrapreneurship by impacting the behaviour of individuals. When individuals behave intrapreneurially it will lead to outcomes as new product / innovation, new business venturing, or self-renewal [@neessen2019].

![Framework of intrapreneurship by @neessen2019](./thesis/figures/intrapreneurship-framework.png){#fig:intrapreneurship-framework}

The framework of @neessen2019 displays intrapreneurship as the sum of intrapreneurial behaviour and corporate entrepreneurship. The dimensions of intrapreneurial behaviours are defined as proactivity, innovativeness, risk-taking, opportunity recognition and exploitation, and networking. A review of @gawke2019 found three prominent conceptualisations of employee intrapreneurship in academic literature. Intrapreneurship can be seen as the employees participation in organisation's intrapreneurial pursuits (the intrapreneurial outcomes approach), the contribution of employee activities to strategic renewal and new ventures of an organisation (the behaviour-based approach) or as the employees' entrepreneurial orientation. This entrepreneurial orientation is conceptualised as the tendency toward innovativeness, risk taking and personal initiative. This last conceptualisation is commonly accepted in the literature to measure intrapreneurial behaviour [@deJong2011; @neessen2019; @gawke2019; @stam2012]. As we are primarily concerned with the behaviour of an individual and not the outcomes of that behaviour, this research follows the entrepreneurial orientation by adopting the view point of @deJong2011 on intrapreneurial behaviour. These authors describe intrapreneurial behaviour "as the identification and exploitation of opportunities by individual workers that (also) advance the organisation".

## 2.2 The role of autonomy

Labor market conditions are changing. Rapid technological progress, increased employee tenure, a rise in high-skilled job, and request for more flexibility all indicate an increased need for autonomy [@stiglbauer2018]. Companies are advised to grant employees a greater span of control in order to leverage digital technologies and employee's expertise [@mueckeHowDoesJob2019]. As autonomy is becoming a more prominent work characteristic it can be of value to further investigate its relationship with intrapreneurial behaviour.

Autonomy is an influencing factor for intrapreneurial behaviour [@neessen2019]. Giving employees the freedom to design its own work and make decisions results into more intrapreneurial activities and higher levels of self-efficacy [@neessen2019]. On that same note @deJong2015 found that job autonomy leads to higher levels of intrapreneurial behaviour, especially on its innovation and proactivity dimensions.

However, @gerards2021 states that the positive relation between autonomy and intrapreneurial behaviour is ambiguous. One stream states that autonomy has shown to influence intrapreneurial behaviour thru the mediating effect of a transformational leadership style [@gerards2021]. Another stream states that employees will be reluctant to show initiative when organisations and leaders emphasise efficiency and flawlessness, even when given autonomy [@jung2003; @yukl2001]. Additionally, both autonomy and innovative behaviour have shown meaningful variability on daily basis [@zacher2014]. On days of perceived high autonomy employees are more likely to generate novel ideas, proactively tackle work-related problems and be more inclined to innovate [@ohly2009; @orth2017].

@@ elaborate more on the dark side of too much autonomy

A "too-much-of-a-good-thing" effect exist for autonomy. @zhou2020 discovered that giving too much autonomy to an individual has a tipping point. When exceeding that tipping point too much of autonomy displayed to be detrimental for the individual.

Much of the existing literature researches autonomy from the provisioning aspect of an organisation [e.g. @deJong2015]. These studies see the relation between autonomy and intrapreneurial behaviour thru the lens of job design [see @deJong2015; @rigtering2013; @gawke2019]. Although the organisation can offer autonomy, whether the autonomy will be taken will depend on the individual. Additionally reactions on high autonomy levels strongly depend upon individual and/or contextual characteristics [@stiglbauer2018]. @jong2021 argues that it is critical to not only examine job autonomy on its own, but to examine the congruence between autonomy and preference for autonomy. The person-environment theory offers a perspective to research this congruence. Seen in simple terms, the needs and supplies of autonomy can be either a fit or a misfit.

Not all individuals will display the same behaviour, even when they are in the same environment. To find possible reasons for this difference a popular theory is Person-Environment fit theory. "Person-Environment fit is generally defined as the compatibility between individuals and their environment [@vanVianen2018]". The theory suggests that the attitudes, behaviours, and other outcomes, do not result from the person or environment separately, but rather from the relationship between the two [@jong2021]. Meaning, if the characteristics of an individual are aligned with those of the environment, it will lead to a certain outcome in behaviour. Person-environment fit theory examines how job attitudes are explained by the fit between individuals and their work situation [@jong2021].

Key assumption of person-environment fit theory is that people have an innate need to fit their environments [@vanVianen2018]. Having a fit allows individuals to better understand the behaviours of others and facilitates interpersonal interactions. They compare themselves with other people in their social environment [@vanVianen2018]. Perfect fit, however, is a rare circumstance [@vanVianen2018]. People make suboptimal choices, and individuals and their environments change over time [@vanVianen2018]. A dominant model in current person-environment fit theory is @schneider1987 attraction-selection-attrition (ASA) model [@simmering2003]. This model posits that employees are attracted to organisations that provide a high level of fit, are selected by organisations that recognise this fit, and leave the organisation when misfit occurs. This deemphasises the possibility that individuals might change themselves rather then just leave the organisation [@simmering2003]. Although individuals and organisations might strive for fit during attraction and selection, researching misfits might provide organisations with more tangible advise and insights to change their selection strategies, or to help new hires to adopt to their situation.

To answer our main hypothesis in this research the fit concept of needs-supplies is chosen. Needs-supplies fit displays the alignment of the employees needs, desires, or preferences and the supply provided by the job they perform [@kristof2005] The reason for this is twofold: 1) autonomy is typically researched in the context of person-job fit [@vanVianen2018], and 2) needs-supplies fit has the greatest impact on job attitudes [@kristof2005]. Regarding the effects of (mis)fit two opposing views are prevalent. The affective-consistency based view states that a needs-supplies fit gives rise to positive attitudes, which in turn acts as motivators [@yu2016]. The view of self-regulation holds an opposite perspective. Within this view the core principle of cybernetics is followed that a negative feedback loop is required to get in motion [@edwards1992]. In other words, there has to be a misfit in order to engage in certain behaviour. The research of @yu2016 showed that a misfit of autonomy yields proactive behaviour at an individual, supporting the self-regulatory view.

### 2.2.1 @@ The affective-consistency based view

Prevalent idea in the affective-cognitive based view is that a needs-supplies fit is required in order to be motivated [@yu2016]. The view posits that when a person experience positive work-based emotions, the person would be inclined to adjust or perceive aspect so that a person-environment fit exists. Likewise, negative emotions would lead a person to be inclined that a misfit exists [@yu2009]. To illustrate with an example, when an individual has had a good period of work with the flexibility to schedule its own day and make own decision, this person would like perceive a fit of autonomy, For an individual that has been told what to do for a period of time, and haven't been allowed to make its own decisions while being custom to it, a misfit is most likely to be perceived.

Many researches has implicitly or explicitly researched this affective-consistency based view. A fit between the autonomy needs and supplies can be viewed from the existing literature that treats autonomy as a job resource or job design perspective. Although the person-environment fit is not directly used in this research, it does display an underlying assumption that providing autonomy will lead to positive work experiences and as such enhance the perceived fit.

@deJong2015 found that job autonomy was directly related to the intrapreneurial dimensions of innovativeness and proactiveness. Job autonomy in this research made a difference towards entrepreneurial behaviour. Job performance is also affected by job autonomy. @mueckeHowDoesJob2019 found that job autonomy leads to better performance as it enhance work motivation and reduces mental strain. In conjunction with high-quality leader-member exchange, job autonomy strengthens the effect of this exchange on creative work. Summarising, job autonomy has been found to have positive outcomes on a variety of perspectives.

> Hypothesis 1a: A perceived needs-supplies fit on autonomy will positively effect intrapreneurial behaviour

> Hypothesis 1b: A perceived needs-supplies misfit on autonomy will lead to negative or no effect on intrapreneurial behaviour

Nevertheless, the nature of this research discards the desire to have autonomy in contrast to the autonomy supplied by the organisation. @deJong2015 for example, already mentioned the limitation that highly entrepreneurial employees may be the ones that obtain high-autonomy functions. This potentially skews it findings. Investigating the effects of job autonomy on intrapreneurship warrants a person-environment fit view.

### 2.2.2 The self-regulatory view

Core principle of the self-regulating view is its focus on a negative feedback loop. This loop is essential to minimise differences between aspects of the environment and relevant reference criteria of the individual [@edwards1992]. The self-regeulatory core premise is the realisation that an individuals experience leads to a negative effect and consequently leads to an action or intervention to improve. An example provided by @edwards1992 argues that the experience of stress by an individual has a negative effect on well-being. This might lead to a negative affect and kickstarts a coping behaviour to improve that wellbeing. Just like a thermostat recognising that the temperature is off the desired level, it triggers the boiler to heat up to get the room to the desired temperature.

Following the self-regulatory view a perceived misfit of autonomy is required to get individuals in motion. Likewise @vanVianen2018 states that experiencing misfit as an individual will lead to adaptation. Depending on the misfit perception, opportunities to repair the misfit, and environmental and individual mitigating factors it might motivate individuals to leave the job or adapt to the situation [@vanVianen2018]. Academic literature holds powerful examples of beneficial misfits. For example, in a study that examines autonomy fit and personal development, @simmering2003 found that autonomy misfit is essential to create the need for personal development by the individual. Autonomy misfit for newcomers has shown to lead to higher levels of proactive behaviour [@yu2016]. Arguing the case for the self-regulatory view of needs-supplies misfit. Consequently, if misfit is required to get people into motion, a needs-supplies fit will not have any impact on intrapreneurial behaviour. As such I hypothesise:

> Hypothesis 2a: A perceived needs-supplies fit on autonomy will have no effect on intrapreneurial behaviour

The exact nature of misfit might yield to different outcomes. Misfit can either be an excess of supply or be a deficiency of what the individual needs. An individual can be affected by a lack of autonomy (deficiency) or be troubled due to an oversupply of autonomy (excess).
Which type of misfit is experienced will make a difference on their impact. Additionally @lambert2003 showed that not all experienced misfits is of importance for the individual. Meaning, that although there is a misfit, it does not have a consequence on behaviour, attitudes or outcome.

Various studies argued a linear relationship between the deficiency of autonomy and its impact on behaviour. @stiglbauer2018 showed that deficient misfit had a linear effect on well-being, meaning that any increase from a deficient misfit to fit leads to an equal improvement on well-being. Additionally the research showed that slight deficiency misfit actually foster employees growth and well-being, confirming the self-regulatory view.

> Hypothesis 2b: The relationship between a deficiency of autonomy misfit and intrapreneurial behaviour (P > E) is roughly linear

It is believed that an excess of misfit will do less harm then a deficient misfit [@vanVianen2018]. The research of @yu2016 investigated the level of proactivity for newcomers in an organisation, based on their personal needs for autonomy and what was supplied by the organisation. Here, the authors found that an excess of autonomy misfit lead to higher levels of proactivity compared to fit and deficient misfit. This shows that in case of an excess misfit, more autonomy provided then desired, leads to stronger adoption of the individual to belong [@yu2016].

The "too-much-of-a-good-thing" effects argues that excess levels can be too high for an individual. Substantial levels of excess autonomy has shown to decrease an individuals well-being [@stiglbauer2018]. @zhou2020 argues that increase of autonomy leads to a depletion of job resources and consequently the subjective well-being of an individual will decline. This is unproblematic until a tipping point is reached for an individual and the loss is larger then the gain.

An excess of autonomy therefore is unproblematic, but not indefinitely. At some point the individual will perceive the autonomy as a burden and from that moment negatively impact intrapreneurial behaviour. The effect of excess autonomy on intrapreneurial behaviour is deemed to be curvilinear instead of linear.

> Hypothesis 2c: The relationship between an excess of autonomy misfit and intrapreneurial behaviour (E > P) is curvilinear

## 2.3 Psychological safety

Today's business environment accomplishes much of its work in collaboration [@edmondsonLei2014; @newman2017; @frazier2017]. Rather then being individuals at work, multi-disciplined teams are working collectively to accomplish their goals. Product design, patient care, strategy development, and rescue operations are a few examples that call for collaborative work [@edmondsonLei2014]. The field of organisational research has identified psychological safety as an important factor in how people collaborate to achieve a shared outcome [@edmondsonLei2014].

Psychological safety is the shared belief by members of the team that the team is safe for interpersonal risk-taking [@edmondson1999; @edmondsonLei2014; @frazier2017; @newman2017]. Individuals that feel psychologically safe in a team will be less concerned with the way others might react when introducing a new idea or when voicing a concern. High levels of psychological safety has been linked to higher levels of creative thinking and risk-taking, innovation in R&D teams, process improvements in manufacturing, knowledge creation, and successful implementation of technology [@newman2017]. @frazier2017 recognises that psychological safety is a key factor in facilitating the process of learning, collaborating, and employee engagement.

The performance enabling role of psychological safety has consistently been found in numerous studies [@edmondsonLei2014]. Especially when organisational learning is of importance, psychological safety is relevant [@edmondsonLei2014]. Much of today's organisational learning happens between the interactions of interdependent individuals. Individual's concerns about interpersonal risk or consequences could limit the learning behaviours of these individuals. High levels of psychological safety can reduce these concerns and as such contribute to organisational learning.

Psychological safety is both an individual-level and team level construct [@edmondsonLei2014; @frazier2017]. However, @edmondsonLei2014 argues that the group is the appropriate level to measure psychological safety. "Starting with Edmondson (1999), studies have found statistically significant variance in psychological safety between groups within organisations; that is, people working closely together tend to have similar perceptions of psychological safety, which vary across groups within the same organisation. This body of work thereby supports the idea that psychological safety in organisational life can best be considered a phenomenon that lives at the group level. [@edmondsonLei2014]".

## 2.4 Psychological safety impacting intrapreneurial behaviour

Individual elements of the intrapreneurial behaviour construct has been linked to psychological safety. Risk-taking, for example, is enhanced by psychological safety [@edmondson1999; @newman2017]. Likewise, enhancements of creative thinking, innovation, process improvements are outcomes of teams that have a high level of psychological safety [@newman2017]. Members of a team in a psychologically safe climate share more information, speak up with suggestion for organisational improvements, and are found to take initiative to develop new products and services [@edmondsonLei2014].

@deStobbeleir2020 discovered that in psychological safe teams members engage in feedback seeking among team members. This type of feedback seeking can be labeled as "relational proactivity", aligning well with the networking dimension of intrapreneurial behaviour. Feedback seeking positively contributes to experimentation and learning. Psychological safety is strongly related to team learning and performance in environments that benefit from learning [@sanner2015]. An appropriate culture that allows experimentations, feedback, and learning by trial and error is one of the two required aspects to unfold intrapreneurs' potential [@gawke2019]. The other aspect being proactive intrapreneurs.

Psychological safety has been found to effect components of intrapreneurial behaviour and intrapreneurial outcomes as described in the framework ([@fig:intrapreneurship-framework]) of @neessen2019. Given the impact on these isolated components I hypothesise that there is a relation between psychological safety and the complete construct of intrapreneurial behaviour. To my knowledge there has not been any distinctive research that linked psychological safety to the complete construct of intrapreneurial behaviour.

> Hypothesis 3: Psychological safety is positively related to intrapreneurial behaviour

## 2.5 Psychological safety to influence the effects of autonomy misfit

Getting to intrapreneurial outcomes like new products or self-renewal isn't an individual effort, but a team effort. As today's work is mostly accomplished in collaboration [@edmondsonLei2014; @newman2017; @frazier2017], the effects of an individual autonomy misfit can be influenced by others in the group. As individuals work in teams, it's the reaction of those team members to the individual that potentially impacts its attitude to the job. As such, the team can be influential in supporting an individual towards intrapreneurial behaviour. Whether or not the psychological safety in a team influences an individuals intrapreneurial behaviour answers a call for further research by @neessen2019.

Moderating effects of psychological safety has been proven extensively in academic literature. In their systematic literature review @newman2017 already summarised that psychological safety weakens the negative relationship between role conceptualisation and achievement orientation, expertise diversity influence the team performance, and the relationship between process innovativeness and profitability. This moderating effect has been found on individual, team, and organisational level. This prior research gives viability to a potentially moderating effect of psychological safety between autonomy (mis)fit and intrapreneurial behaviour.

### 2.5.1 When needs and supplies of fit are unbalanced

An excess of misfit has shown to lead individuals to adapt to the situation. @yu2016 discovered that an excess of misfit lead to higher levels of proactive behaviour by the individual. @ashford1996 identified seven key types of change-oriented proactive behaviours: feedback seeking; information seeking; job change negotiation; positive framing; general socialising; building relationships with the boss; and networking. Especially information seeking and feedback seeking has been found to be influenced by psychological safety [@vanVianen2018; @deStobbeleir2020]. Feedback seeking may be beneficial for individuals to cope with the misfit of autonomy [@vanVianen2018]. Teams with high levels of psychological safety ensure that information will be sought within the team, where in teams with low levels of psychological safety information will be sought outside the team [@safdar2017; @deStobbeleir2020].

Following the self-regulatory view, an excess of autonomy will give individuals an impetus to engage in intrapreneurial behaviour. Given that an excess of autonomy misfit leads to higher levels of proactivity, proactivity being a key behavioural dimension of intrapreneurship, and acknowledging the existing literature on the influencing effect psychological safety has on proactivity, I hypothesise:

> Hypothesis 4a: Psychological safety strengthens the positive effect of an excess autonomy misfit towards intrapreneurial behaviour

Additionally, @yu2016 showed that also a deficiency of misfit yields to proactive behaviour, although lower then the case of excess misfit. Clarification for this difference has not been provided by the authors. A possible explanation can be found in the findings of @lambert2003 that deficient misfit leads to greater job dissatisfaction for specific inducements. The dissatisfaction of work has been found to lead to creativity [@zhou2001], Likewise, @vanVianen2018 noted that “Seeking feedback may help individuals to better cope with misfit by putting effort into learning or adjusting to the job demands.”

> Hypothesis 4b: Psychological safety strengthens the positive effect of an excess autonomy misfit towards intrapreneurial behaviour

### 2.5.2 When autonomy is a fit

Following the job design perspective that autonomy fit leads to more intrapreneurial behaviour [@deJong2015] and better performance [@mueckeHowDoesJob2019], it can be hypothesised that psychological safety will have a positive influence on the intrapreneurial behaviour of members in a team with autonomy fit. Psychological safety has proven to have positive effect on the learning behaviour of teams [@edmondson1999; @edmondsonLei2014; @frazier2017]. Learning behaviour is described by @edmondson1999 as "learning at the group level of analysis as an ongoing process of reflection and action, characterised by asking questions, seeking feedback, experimenting,reflecting on results, and discussing errors or unexpected outcomes of actions". These behaviours are positively related with the performance of the team [@edmondson1999; @edmondsonLei2014; @frazier2017]. @choo2007 found that psychological safety influenced creativity, divergent thinking, risk taking, and motivates engagement in learning, increasing the performance of the team as such. Additionally, @frazier2017, found that work design characteristics (including autonomy) positively influence psychological safety.

> Hypothesis 4c: Psychological safety strengthens the positive effect of autonomy fit towards intrapreneurial behaviour

The concepts and relationships of this research have been visualised in the research framework ([@fig:research-framework]).
