# 2. Literature research

The theoretical framework of this study is centred around key concepts discussed in the problem statement. Meaning of these concepts are detailed and explained using literature study. A visual model of this study can be seen in [@fig:research-framework].

## 2.1 What is intrapreneurship & intrapreneurial behaviour?

“Intrapreneurship is a process whereby employee(s) recognise and exploit opportunities by being innovative, proactive and by taking risks, in order for the organisation to create new products, processes and services, initiate self-renewal or venture new businesses to enhance the competitiveness and performance of the organisation [@neessen2019]”. In academic literature "intrapreneurship" usually refers to individual workers rather than organisations or boardroom-level decision makers [@deJong2011]. This thesis adopts the point of view that intrapreneurship is a bottom-up approach [@deJong2011; @neessen2019]. Some literature uses intrapreneurship as a synonym to corporate entrepreneurship [@deJong2011]. However, both terms are distinct concepts. In line with @deJong2011 this thesis regards corporate entrepreneurship as a top-down process that can be used by business owners and general managers to foster new ventures, innovation, and strategic renewal.

Characteristically, intrapreneurship should be seen as a process. Intrapreneurship "is about a set of activities of an individual or an organisation to get from point A to point B in time, with an increased competitiveness and performance of the organisation as the end goal [@neessen2019]”. This definition shows that intrapreneurship is not simply a behaviour of an individual or an organisation, but rather a complex construct of various activities. The framework makes a clear distinction between organisational and individual constructs. For example, the managerial support or organisational structure influences intrapreneurship. Attitudes and characteristics of individuals likewise influence intrapreneurship by impacting the behaviour of individuals. When individuals behave intrapreneurially it will lead to outcomes as new product or innovation, new business venturing, or self-renewal [@neessen2019].

The framework of @neessen2019 displays intrapreneurship as the sum of intrapreneurial behaviour and corporate entrepreneurship. The dimensions of intrapreneurial behaviours are defined as proactivity, innovativeness, risk-taking, opportunity recognition and exploitation, and networking. A review of @gawke2019 found three prominent conceptualisations of employee intrapreneurship in academic literature. Intrapreneurship can be seen as the employee's participation in organisation's intrapreneurial pursuits (the intrapreneurial outcomes approach), the contribution of employee activities to strategic renewal and new ventures of an organisation (the behaviour-based approach) or as the employees' entrepreneurial orientation. This entrepreneurial orientation of the employee is conceptualised as the tendency toward innovativeness, risk taking and personal initiative. This last conceptualisation is commonly accepted in the literature to measure intrapreneurial behaviour [@deJong2011; @neessen2019; @gawke2019; @stam2012]. This research is primarily concerned with the behaviour of an individual and not the outcomes of that behaviour. As such the entrepreneurial orientation is followed by adopting the viewpoint of @deJong2011 on intrapreneurial behaviour. In this viewpoint intrapreneurial behaviour is defined "as the identification and exploitation of opportunities by individual workers that (also) advance the organisation".

## 2.2 The role of autonomy

Labour market conditions are changing. Rapid technological progress, increased employee tenure, a rise in high-skilled job, and request for more flexibility all indicate an increased need for autonomy [@stiglbauer2018]. Companies are advised to grant employees a greater span of control in order to leverage digital technologies and employee's expertise [@mueckeHowDoesJob2019]. With autonomy becoming a more prominent work characteristic further investigation of its relationship with intrapreneurial behaviour can be of value.

Autonomy is an influencing factor for intrapreneurial behaviour [@neessen2019]. Giving employees the freedom to design its own work and make decisions results into more intrapreneurial activities and higher levels of self-efficacy [@neessen2019]. On that same note @deJong2015 found that job autonomy leads to higher levels of intrapreneurial behaviour, especially on its innovation and proactivity dimensions.

However, @gerards2021 states that the positive relation between autonomy and intrapreneurial behaviour is ambiguous. One stream state that autonomy has shown to influence intrapreneurial behaviour thru the mediating effect of a transformational leadership style [@gerards2021]. Another stream states that employees will be reluctant to show initiative when organisations and leaders emphasise efficiency and flawlessness, even when given autonomy [@jung2003; @yukl2001]. Additionally, both autonomy and innovative behaviour have shown meaningful variability on daily basis [@zacher2014]. On days of perceived high autonomy employees are more likely to generate novel ideas, proactively tackle work-related problems and be more inclined to innovate [@ohly2009; @orth2017].

Much of the existing literature research autonomy from the provisioning aspect of an organisation [e.g., @deJong2015]. These studies see the relation between autonomy and intrapreneurial behaviour thru the lens of job design [see @deJong2015; @rigtering2013; @gawke2019]. Although an organisation offers autonomy, whether the autonomy will be used will depend per individual. How individuals respond on high levels of autonomy strongly depend upon individual and/or contextual characteristics [@stiglbauer2018]. @jong2021 argues that it is critical to not only examine job autonomy on its own, but to examine the congruence between autonomy and preference for autonomy. The person-environment theory offers a perspective to research this congruence. Seen in simple terms, the needs and supplies of autonomy can be either a fit or a misfit.

Not all individuals will display the same behaviour, even when they are in the same environment. To find possible reasons for this difference a popular theory is Person-Environment fit theory. "Person-Environment fit is generally defined as the compatibility between individuals and their environment [@vanVianen2018]". The theory suggests that the attitudes, behaviours, and other outcomes, do not result from the person or environment separately, but rather from the relationship between the two [@jong2021]. Meaning, if the characteristics of an individual are aligned with those of the environment, it will lead to a certain outcome in behaviour. Person-Environment fit theory examines how job attitudes are explained by the fit between individuals and their work situation [@jong2021].

Key assumption of Person-Environment fit theory is that people have an innate need to fit with their environments [@vanVianen2018]. Having a fit allows individuals to better understand the behaviours of others and facilitates interpersonal interactions. They compare themselves with other people in their social environment [@vanVianen2018]. Perfect fit, however, is a rare circumstance. People make suboptimal choices, and individuals and their environments change over time [@vanVianen2018]. A dominant model in current person-environment fit theory is the attraction-selection-attrition (ASA) model from @schneider1987 [@simmering2003]. This model posits that employees are attracted to organisations that provide a high level of fit, are selected by organisations that recognise this fit, and leave the organisation when misfit occurs. This deemphasises the possibility that individuals might change themselves rather than leaving the organisation [@simmering2003]. Although individuals and organisations might strive for fit during attraction and selection, researching misfits might provide organisations with more tangible advise and insights to change their selection strategies, or to help new hires to adopt to their situation.

To answer the main hypothesis in this research the fit concept of needs-supplies is chosen. Needs-supplies fit displays the alignment of the employee's needs, desires, or preferences and the supply provided by the job they perform [@kristof2005] The reason for this is twofold: 1) autonomy is typically researched in the context of person-job fit [@vanVianen2018], and 2) needs-supplies fit has the greatest impact on job attitudes [@kristof2005]. Regarding the effects of (mis)fit two opposing views are prevalent. The affective-consistency based view states that a needs-supplies fit gives rise to positive attitudes, which in turn acts as motivators [@yu2016]. The view of self-regulation holds an opposite perspective. Within this view the core principle of cybernetics is followed that a negative feedback loop is required to get in motion [@edwards1992]. In other words, there must be a misfit in order to engage in certain behaviour. Research of @yu2016 shows that a misfit of autonomy yields proactive behaviour at an individual, supporting the self-regulatory view.

### 2.2.1 The affective-consistency based view

Prevalent idea in the affective-consistency based view is that a needs-supplies fit is required to be motivated [@yu2016]. The view posits that individual experiences of positive work-based emotions, will lead to a person-environment fit. The positive experience leads individuals to adjust or perceive that aspect so that a person-environment fit exists. Likewise, negative emotions would lead a person to be inclined that a misfit exists [@yu2009]. A fit would be perceived when an individual has been given the amount of autonomy that fits their individual needs. The effect of perceiving this fit will positively influence the motivation of the individual. When an individual would like to have more or less autonomy than what's been given, a misfit is perceived. The misfit would negatively influence the motivation of the individual.

Many studies have implicitly or explicitly researched this affective-consistency based view. A fit between the autonomy needs and supplies can be viewed from the existing literature that treats autonomy from a job design perspective. Although the person-environment fit is not directly used in this existing research, it does display an underlying assumption that providing autonomy will lead to positive work experiences and as such enhance the perceived fit.

@deJong2015 found that job autonomy was directly related to the intrapreneurial dimensions of innovativeness and proactiveness. Job autonomy in this research made a difference towards intrapreneurial behaviour. Job performance is also affected by job autonomy. @mueckeHowDoesJob2019 found that job autonomy leads to better performance as it enhances work motivation and reduces mental strain. In conjunction with high-quality leader-member exchange, job autonomy strengthens the effect of this exchange on creative work. Summarising, job autonomy has been found to have positive outcomes on a variety of perspectives. Yet, underlying in all these positive outcomes is a fit between the autonomy needs and supplies. Meaning, if an individual need of autonomy fits the organisational supply, higher levels of intrapreneurial behaviour will be shown. Following the Person-Environment perspective fit will show a linear effect on its outcome. When both person and environment is low, the outcome variable will be low. High levels for person and environment will lead to high levels for the outcome variable. For example, @jong2021 found that work outcomes were at their highest levels only when the need and supply of autonomy both were high.

Nevertheless, the nature of this view discards the need for autonomy in contrast to the autonomy supplied by the organisation. @deJong2015 for example, already mentioned the limitation that highly intrapreneurial employees may be the ones that obtain high-autonomy functions. This potentially skews it findings.

### 2.2.2 The self-regulatory view

Core principle of the self-regulating view is its focus on a negative feedback loop. This loop is essential to minimise differences between aspects of the environment and relevant reference criteria of the individual [@edwards1992]. The core premise is the realisation that an individual's experience leads to a negative effect and consequently leads to an action or intervention to improve. An example provided by @edwards1992 argues that the experience of stress by an individual has a negative effect on well-being. This leads to negative feelings and kickstarts a coping behaviour to improve that well-being. Just like a thermostat recognising that the temperature is not on the desired level, it triggers the boiler to heat up and get the room to the desired temperature.

Following the self-regulatory view, a perceived misfit of autonomy is required to get individuals in motion. Likewise, @vanVianen2018 states that experiencing misfit as an individual will lead to adaptation. Depending on the misfit perception, opportunities to repair the misfit, environmental and individual mitigating factors might motivate individuals to leave the job or adapt to the situation [@vanVianen2018]. Academic literature holds powerful examples of beneficial misfits. For example, in a study that examines autonomy fit and personal development, @simmering2003 found that autonomy misfit is essential to create the need for personal development by the individual. Autonomy misfit for newcomers has shown to lead to higher levels of proactive behaviour [@yu2016]. Arguing the case for the self-regulatory view of needs-supplies misfit. Consequently, if misfit is required to get people into motion, a needs-supplies fit will lead people to refrain from showing intrapreneurial behaviour or simply lower levels of that behaviour.

The exact nature of misfit might yield to different outcomes. Misfit can either be an excess of supply or be a deficiency of what the individual needs. An individual can be affected by a lack of autonomy (deficiency) or be troubled due to an oversupply of autonomy (excess). Which type of misfit is experienced will make a difference on their impact. Additionally, @lambert2003 showed that not all experienced misfits are of importance for the individual. Meaning, that although there is a misfit, it does not have a consequence on behaviour, attitudes or outcome.

Various studies argue a linear relationship between the deficiency of autonomy and its impact on behaviour. @stiglbauer2018 showed that deficient misfit had a linear effect on well-being, meaning that any increase from a deficient misfit to fit leads to an equal improvement on well-being. Additionally, the research showed that slight deficiency misfit actually foster employee's growth and well-being, confirming the self-regulatory view. In a study of employee's online sharing of knowledge, the authors found an equal linear effect on job autonomy [@pee2017].

It is believed that an excess of misfit will do less harm than a deficient misfit [@vanVianen2018]. The research of @yu2016 investigated the level of proactivity for newcomers in an organisation, based on their personal needs for autonomy and what was supplied by the organisation. Here, the authors found that an excess of autonomy misfit led to higher levels of proactivity compared to fit and deficient misfit. This shows that in case of an excess misfit, meaning more autonomy provided then desired, leads to stronger adoption of the individual to belong in the organisation [@yu2016].

A "too-much-of-a-good-thing" effect exist for autonomy. @zhou2020 discovered that giving too much autonomy to an individual has a tipping point. When exceeding that tipping point too much of autonomy displayed to be detrimental for the individual. Substantial levels of excess autonomy have shown to decrease an individual's well-being [@stiglbauer2018]. @zhou2020 argues that an increase of autonomy leads to a depletion of job resources and consequently the subjective well-being of an individual will decline. An excess of autonomy therefore is unproblematic, but not indefinitely. At some point the individual will perceive the autonomy as a burden and from that moment negatively impact intrapreneurial behaviour. The effect of excess autonomy on intrapreneurial behaviour is deemed to be curvilinear instead of linear.

Summarising, the affective-consistency based view is centred around autonomy fit. Individual need and organisational supply is required to be aligned, so that positive emotions will positively influence intrapreneurial behaviour. Which leads to our first hypothesis:

> Hypothesis 1: (a) Intrapreneurial behaviour will be lower when individual needs and organisational supply are both low and will be higher when both are high; (b) intrapreneurial behaviour will increase as organisational supply of autonomy increases towards individual autonomy need (fit), and will decrease as organisational supply exceeds individual need.

The self-regulatory view assumes individual autonomy needs and organisational autonomy supply need to be incongruent. Without this misfit, people will not come into motion and behave intrapreneurially. Leading to our second hypothesis:

> Hypothesis 2: (a) Intrapreneurial behaviour will be lower when individual needs and organisational supply are both low or both high; (b) Intrapreneurial behaviour will increase when the difference between individual needs and organisational supply (misfit) increases.

## 2.3 Psychological safety

Today's business environment accomplishes much of its work in collaboration [@edmondsonLei2014; @newman2017; @frazier2017]. Rather than being individuals at work, multi-disciplined teams are working collectively to accomplish their goals. Product design, patient care, strategy development, and rescue operations are a few examples that call for collaborative work [@edmondsonLei2014]. The field of organisational research has identified psychological safety as an important factor in how people collaborate to achieve a shared outcome [@edmondsonLei2014].

Psychological safety is the shared belief by members of the team that the team is safe for interpersonal risk-taking [@edmondson1999; @edmondsonLei2014; @frazier2017; @newman2017]. Individuals that feel psychologically safe in a team will be less concerned with the way others might react when introducing a new idea or when voicing a concern. High levels of psychological safety have been linked to higher levels of creative thinking and risk-taking, innovation in R&D teams, process improvements in manufacturing, knowledge creation, and successful implementation of technology [@newman2017]. @frazier2017 recognises that psychological safety is a key factor in facilitating the process of learning, collaborating, and employee engagement.

The performance enabling role of psychological safety has consistently been found in numerous studies [@edmondsonLei2014]. Especially when organisational learning is of importance, psychological safety is relevant [@edmondsonLei2014]. Much of today's organisational learning happens between the interactions of interdependent individuals. Individual's concerns about interpersonal risk or consequences could limit the learning behaviours of these individuals. High levels of psychological safety can reduce these concerns and as such contribute to organisational learning.

Psychological safety is both an individual-level and team level construct [@edmondsonLei2014; @frazier2017]. However, @edmondsonLei2014 argues that the group is the appropriate level to measure psychological safety. "Starting with Edmondson (1999), studies have found statistically significant variance in psychological safety between groups within organisations; that is, people working closely together tend to have similar perceptions of psychological safety, which vary across groups within the same organisation. This body of work thereby supports the idea that psychological safety in organisational life can best be considered a phenomenon that lives at the group level. [@edmondsonLei2014]".

## 2.4 Psychological safety impacting intrapreneurial behaviour

Individual elements of the intrapreneurial behaviour construct have been linked to psychological safety. Risk-taking, for example, is enhanced by psychological safety [@edmondson1999; @newman2017]. Likewise, enhancements of creative thinking, innovation, process improvements are outcomes of teams that have a high level of psychological safety [@newman2017]. Members of a team in a psychologically safe climate share more information, speak up with suggestion for organisational improvements, and are found to take initiative to develop new products and services [@edmondsonLei2014].

@deStobbeleir2020 discovered that in psychological safe teams, members engage in feedback seeking among team members. This type of feedback seeking can be labelled as "relational proactivity", aligning well with the networking dimension of intrapreneurial behaviour. Feedback seeking positively contributes to experimentation and learning. Psychological safety is strongly related to team learning and performance in environments that benefit from learning [@sanner2015]. An appropriate culture that allows experimentations, feedback, and learning by trial and error is one of the two required aspects to unfold intrapreneurs' potential [@gawke2019]. The other aspect being proactivity.

Psychological safety has been found to effect components of intrapreneurial behaviour and intrapreneurial outcomes as described in the framework of @neessen2019. Given the impact on these isolated components the author hypothesises that a relation between psychological safety and the complete construct of intrapreneurial behaviour exists. To the author's knowledge there has not been any distinctive research that linked psychological safety to the complete construct of intrapreneurial behaviour.

> Hypothesis 3: Psychological safety is positively related to intrapreneurial behaviour

## 2.5 Psychological safety to influence the effects of autonomy misfit

Getting to intrapreneurial outcomes like new products or self-renewal isn't an individual effort, but a team effort. As today's work is mostly accomplished in collaboration [@edmondsonLei2014; @newman2017; @frazier2017], the effects of an autonomy misfit for a team member can be influenced by others in the group. As individuals work in teams, it's the reaction of those team members to the individual that potentially impacts its attitude to the job. As such, the team can be influential in supporting an individual towards intrapreneurial behaviour. Whether or not the psychological safety in a team influences the intrapreneurial behaviour of team members answers a call for further research by @neessen2019.

Moderating effects of psychological safety has been proven extensively in academic literature. In the systematic literature review @newman2017 already summarised that psychological safety weakens the negative relationship between role conceptualisation and achievement orientation, expertise diversity influences the team performance, and the relationship between process innovativeness and profitability. This moderating effect has been found on individual, team, and organisational level. This prior research gives viability to a potentially moderating effect of psychological safety between autonomy (mis)fit and intrapreneurial behaviour.

### 2.5.1 Psychological safety in the affective-consistency based view

Following the job design perspective that autonomy fit leads to more intrapreneurial behaviour [@deJong2015] and better performance [@mueckeHowDoesJob2019], it can be hypothesised that psychological safety will have a positive influence on the intrapreneurial behaviour of members in a team with autonomy fit. Psychological safety has proven to have positive effect on the learning behaviour of teams [@edmondson1999; @edmondsonLei2014; @frazier2017]. Learning behaviour is described by @edmondson1999 as "learning at the group level of analysis as an ongoing process of reflection and action, characterised by asking questions, seeking feedback, experimenting, reflecting on results, and discussing errors or unexpected outcomes of actions". These behaviours are positively related with the performance of the team [@edmondson1999; @edmondsonLei2014; @frazier2017]. @choo2007 found that psychological safety influenced creativity, divergent thinking, risk taking, and motivates engagement in learning, increasing the performance of the team as such. Additionally, @frazier2017, found that work design characteristics (including autonomy) positively influence psychological safety.

The premise of the affective-consistency based view is that positive work experience leads to perceived fit by the individual [@yu2009]. Consequently, it is likely that a psychological safe team would lead to positive work experiences. Resulting into a team of which its members perceive a needs-supplies fit on autonomy. Following that logic, it can be hypothesised that according to the affective-consistency based view, intrapreneurial behaviour would be stronger in environments of high psychological safety.

> Hypothesis 4a: The positive relation of needs-supplies fit on autonomy will be stronger when psychological safety is high then when it is low

### 2.5.2 Psychological safety in the self-regulatory based view

A negative experience is required in the self-regulatory view to get individuals in motion. Proponents of this view argue that needs-supplies misfit is required to ignite the negative feedback loop. Consequently, fit will not trigger any feedback loop and people will not act differently.

An excess of misfit has shown to lead individuals to adapt to the situation. @yu2016 discovered that an excess of misfit lead to higher levels of proactive behaviour by the individual. @ashford1996 identified seven key types of change-oriented proactive behaviours: feedback seeking; information seeking; job change negotiation; positive framing; general socialising; building relationships with the boss; and networking. Especially information seeking and feedback seeking has been found to be influenced by psychological safety [@vanVianen2018; @deStobbeleir2020]. Feedback seeking may be beneficial for individuals to cope with the misfit of autonomy [@vanVianen2018]. Teams with high levels of psychological safety ensure that information will be sought within the team, where in teams with low levels of psychological safety information will be sought outside the team [@safdar2017; @deStobbeleir2020].

Following the self-regulatory view, an excess of autonomy will give individuals an impetus to engage in intrapreneurial behaviour. Given that an excess of autonomy misfit leads to higher levels of proactivity, proactivity being a key behavioural dimension of intrapreneurship, and acknowledging the existing literature on the influencing effect psychological safety has on proactivity.

Additionally, @yu2016 showed that also a deficiency of misfit yields to proactive behaviour, although lower than the case of excess misfit. Clarification for this difference has not been provided by the authors. A possible explanation can be found in the findings of @lambert2003 that deficient misfit leads to greater job dissatisfaction for specific inducements. The dissatisfaction of work has been found to lead to creativity [@zhou2001], Likewise, @vanVianen2018 noted that “Seeking feedback may help individuals to better cope with misfit by putting effort into learning or adjusting to the job demands.”

> Hypothesis 4b: The positive relation of needs-supplies misfit on autonomy will be stronger when psychological safety is high then when it is low
