	abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine the leadership expectations of young employees in intrapreneurial jobs. Design/methodology/approach Group interviews were conducted with 42 young intrapreneurs and 13 leaders of a Dutch ICT consultancy firm. Data were coded and analyzed using qualitative data analysis software. Findings The authors find ten different expectations on leadership. Young intrapreneurs expect to have a personal connection, sufficient feedback, ample freedom, and trust, clear directions when asked and a leader who is a role model. Research limitations/implications This qualitative study was conducted in one organization. It however sheds a first light on expectations of employees with intrapreneurial job requirements. Practical implications In order to motivate and guide young intrapreneurs, direct supervisors should aim not to breach expectations. By getting to know their employees on a personal basis, taking the time to coach them in their career goals, showing intrapreneurship themselves, focusing on an open relationship, and providing a challenging and dynamic environment, direct supervisors build a strong and cooperative relationship. Originality/value This paper is one of the first to look at the relationship between direct supervisors and intrapreneurial employees. Doing so, it also expands the current knowledge of Implicit Leadership Theory by exploring expectations of young intrapreneurs and adds to the full-range leadership theory by showing the importance of investigating its subdimensions.},
