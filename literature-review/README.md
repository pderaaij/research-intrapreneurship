# üè´ Literature review for my thesis

This digital garden holds my literature research for my thesis. Researching the impact of autonomy fit on [[intrapreneurship|intrapreneurially behaviour]], moderated by [[psychological-safety]].

Currently I am at the first stages of research and executing my literature review. As such I am formulating the hypothesis and research question. Autonomy fit for example could be replaced by [[empowerment]].

Following my [Digital Garden](https://garden.paulderaaij.nl) experiment I am learning with the garage doors open. This garden follows a structure of fleeting notes, literature notes and permanent notes. Inspired by [Hendrik Erz](https://hendrik-erz.de/post/how-i-work-part-iv-reference-management-reading-literature) and [Martinez Ponciano](https://martinezponciano.es/2021/04/05/from-fleeting-notes-to-literature-notes-obsidian/).

- Fleeting notes are my annotations of the article. They contain direct highlights and additional notes on the article.
- Literature notes are a personal summary and collection of the fleeting note and article. It represents a single article, in my own words, on what I have read.
- A permanent note is meant to capture and synthesise multiple angles and ideas on a topic.

Ultimately I expect to build a graph of permanent notes that are connected to each other on found correlations or potential links.

This workflow is new to me, just like doing this kind on intense literature review, as such this flow is experimental and under development.
