# Person-Environment Fit

Person-Environment fit is concerned about [[2005-kristof#PE Fit is the compatibility between individual and work environment|the compatibility between an individual and work environemnt]]. Assessing the person and environment combined [[2018-vanvianen#Three basic principles of person-environment fit|can predict human behaviour]]. Meaning, if the characteristics of an individual are aligned with those of the environment, it will lead to a certain outcome in behaviour. As such person-environment fit is about matching individuals to various levels of their work environment. Four main types of person-environment fit exists:

| Tyoe of fit             | Focal view                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| Person-job fit          | The relation between a person's characteristics and those of the job or task that are performed at work                                                                                                                                 |
| Person-organisation fit | The compatibility between people and entire organisations                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Person-group fit        | The interpersonal compatibility between individuals and their work groups                                                                                                                                                               |
| Person-supervisor fit   | Examines the dyadic relationship between individuals and others in their work environments. The relationship between supervisor and subordinate has been wildly researched, but could also be about a dyadic relationship between peers |

A fit can be [[2005-kristof#A fit can be complementary or supplementary|complementary or supplementary]]. Complementary fits are a fit when characteristics of the individual fill in a gap for the environment, or vice-versa. Supplementary fits exists when the individuals and the environment are similar.

For example when an accountant joins an organisation that does not hold any accounting capability, the accountant brings in a complementary fit. When an innovative individuals joins an organisation that consists out of innovative employees, it is a supplementary fit.

Fits can be researched [[2005-kristof#Perceived, subjective & objective fit|as perceived, subjective, or objective fit]]:

- **perceived fit**; when an individual makes a direct assessment of the compatibility between person and environment
- **subjective fit**; when fit is assessed indirectly through the comparison of person and environment variables, reported by the same person
- **objective fit**; when fit is calculated indirectly through the comparison of P and E variables as reported by different sources.

Typically people [[2018-vanvianen#Individual appreciate fit and seek it|appreciate fit and seek it]]. Fit has to be found important for people as they prefer consistency, wish to exert control over their life and to reduce uncertainty, have a need to belong, and want happiness and life satisfaction. Achieving fit is associated with positive individual outcomes and relates most strongly to attitude outcomes. However, [[2018-vanvianen#Optimal fit is not always possible or needed|optimal fit is not always possible or needed]]. Especially when fit is high on attributes that individuals find important, [[2018-vanvianen#Individuals flourish when experiencing fit on the attributes they find important|will lead to these individuals to flourish]].
