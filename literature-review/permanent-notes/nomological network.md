# nomological network

A lawful pattern of interrelationships that exists between hypothetical constructs and observable attributes and that guides a researcher in establishing the construct validity of a psychological test or measure.

According to the US psychologists Lee J(oseph) Cronbach (1916–2001) and Paul Everett Meehl (1920–2003), who introduced the concept in an article in the journal Psychological Bulletin in 1955, a nomological network includes a theoretical framework for what is being measured, specifying linkages between different hypothetical constructs, between different observable attributes, and between hypothetical constructs and observable attributes. Qualitatively different measurement operations may be said to measure the same attributes if their locations in the nomological network link them to the same hypothetical construct variable. Also called a nomological net. Compare trait validity. [From Greek nomos a law + logos word, discourse, or reason + Latin -icalis of, relating to, or resembling]
