# Intrapreneurship

Intrapreneurship, synonym to [[2019-neessen#Intrapreneurship and corporate entrepreneurship are synonomous|corporate entrepreneurship]], is a [[2019-neessen#Intrapreneurship is a process|process]] whereby employees recognise and exploit opportunities, by being innovative, proactive and tasking risks. This intrapreneurial behaviour leads to [[2019-neessen#Goals of intrapreneurship|organisational outcomes]] as new products, processes and services, initiate self-renewal, or venture new business. These outcomes enhance the competitiveness and performance of an organisation.

Intrapreneurship is a multi-level construct that consists of intrapreneurial outcomes and intrapreneurial behaviour (@@[[Petra C. M. Neessen]]). These outcomes are described by the [[2019-neessen#Goals of intrapreneurship|goals of intrapreneurship]] namely: new product / innovation, new business venturing, and self-renewal. Intrapreneurial behaviour is formed by the dimensions of _innovativeness_, _proactiveness_, _risk taking_, _opportunity recognition and exploitation_, and _networking_. [[2013-dejong#Innovation, proactivity and risk taking as features of entrepreneurial behaviour|For entrepreneurial behaviour]] three similar features are described: _innovation_, _proactivity_, and _risk taking_.

## Influencing factors of intrapreneurship

Many factors are influencing the ability and willingness to undertake intrapreneurial activities and outcomes.

### Characteristics of intrapreneurs

### Job design variables

It has been found that [[job autonomy]] relates with overall entrepreneurial behaviour and particularly the features of innovation and proactiveness (de Jong, 2013). It increases the perceived control over the work environment which also enhances employee' motivation or willingness to engage in entrepreneurial behaviour.

Job variety on the other hand did relate to overall entrepreneurial behaviour, but not to the distinct features of innovation, proactivity and risk taking. Suggesting that job variety does not contribute to intrapreneurship. This can be due to the fact that job variety only influences the perceived capabilities for entrepreneurial behaviour.
