## Abstract

This paper presents a model of team learning and tests it in a multimethod field study. It introduces the construct of team psychological safety—a shared belief held by members of a team that the team is safe for interpersonal risk taking—and models the effects of team psychological safety and team efficacy together on learning and performance in organizational work teams. Results of a study of 51 work teams in a manufacturing company, measuring antecedent, process, and outcome variables, show that team psychological safety is associated with learning behavior, but team efficacy is not, when controlling for team psychological safety. As predicted, learning behavior mediates between team psychological safety and team performance. The results support an integrative perspective in which both team structures, such as context support and team leader coaching, and shared beliefs shape team outcomes.

> "It introduces the construct of team psychological safety-a shared belief held by members of a team that the team is safe for interpersonal risk taking" ([Edmondson 1999:350](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GCFY8NFT?page=1))

> "team psychological safety is associated with learning behavior, but team efficacy is not, when controlling for team psychological safety." ([Edmondson 1999:350](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GCFY8NFT?page=1))

> ". Although much has been written about teams and about learning in organizations, our understanding of learning in teams remains limited" ([Edmondson 1999:350](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GCFY8NFT?page=1))

In other words, the question is how do teams learn?

> "Many researchers have concluded that structure and design, including equipment, materials, physical environment, and pay systems, are the most important variables for improving work-team performance (Goodman, Devadas, and Hughson, 1988; Campion, Medsker, and Higgs, 1993; Cohen and Ledford, 1994) and have argued against focusing on interpersonal factors (e.g., Goodman, RavIin, and Schminke, 1987). According to this research, organization and team structures explain most of the variance in team effectiveness. In contrast, organizational learning research has emphasized cognitive and interpersonal factors to explain effectiveness, showing, for example, that individuals' tacit beliefs about interpersonal interaction inhibit learning behavior and give rise to ineffectiveness in organizations (e.g., Argyris, 1993)" ([Edmondson 1999:350](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GCFY8NFT?page=1))

> "This paper takes a different approach to understanding learning in organizations by examining to what extent and under what conditions learning occurs naturally in organizational work groups." ([Edmondson 1999:351](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GCFY8NFT?page=2))

> "I propose that to understand learning behavior in teams, team structures and shared beliefs must be investigated jointly, using both quantitative and qualitative methods." ([Edmondson 1999:351](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GCFY8NFT?page=2))

> "Organizational work teams are groups that exist within the context of a larger organization, have clearly defined membership, and share responsibility for a team product or service (Hackman, 1987; Alderfer, 1987). Their learning behavior consists of activities carried out by team members through which a team obtains and processes data that allow it to adapt and improve" ([Edmondson 1999:351](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GCFY8NFT?page=2))

> "Members of groups tend not to share the unique knowledge they hold, such that group discussions consist primarily of jointly held information (Stasser and Titus, 1987), posing a dilemma for learning in groups" ([Edmondson 1999:351](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GCFY8NFT?page=2))

> "More centrally, those in a position to initiate learning behavior may believe they are placing themselves at risk; for example, by admitting an error or asking for help, an individual may appear incompetent and thus suffer a blow to his or her image." ([Edmondson 1999:351](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GCFY8NFT?page=2))

> "In sum, people tend to act in ways that inhibit learning when they face the potential for threat or embarrassment (Argyris, 1982)." ([Edmondson 1999:352](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GCFY8NFT?page=3))

> "An aim of the present study was to investigate whether beliefs about the interpersonal context vary between teams in the same organization, as well as to examine their effects on team outcomes." ([Edmondson 1999:352](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GCFY8NFT?page=3))

> ". In this paper I join the latter tradition in treating learning as a process and attempt to articulate the behaviors through which such outcomes as adaptation to change, greater understanding, or improved performance in teams can be achieved" ([Edmondson 1999:353](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GCFY8NFT?page=4))

> "Similarly, I conceptualize learning at the group level of analysis as an ongoing process of reflection and action, characterized by asking questions, seeking feedback, experimenting, reflecting on results, and discussing errors or unexpected outcomes of actions." ([Edmondson 1999:353](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GCFY8NFT?page=4))

> "On one hand, if feedback seeking, experimentation, and discussion of errors individually promote effective performance, learning behavior-which includes all of these activities-is also likely to facilitate performance, whether for individuals or teams. On the other hand, learning behavior consumes time without assurance of results, suggesting that there are conditions in which it may reduce efficiency and detract from performance," ([Edmondson 1999:354](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GCFY8NFT?page=5))

> "Hypothesis 1 (H1): Learning behavior in teams is positively associated with team performance." ([Edmondson 1999:354](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GCFY8NFT?page=5))

> "Team psychological safety is defined as a shared belief that the team is safe for interpersonal risk taking." ([Edmondson 1999:354](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GCFY8NFT?page=5))

> "For the most part, this belief tends to be tacit-taken for granted and not given direct attention either by individuals or by the team as a whole." ([Edmondson 1999:354](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GCFY8NFT?page=5))

> "Team psychological safety is not the same as group cohesiveness, as research has shown that cohesiveness can reduce willingness to disagree and challenge others' views, such as in the phenomenon of groupthink (Janis, 1982)" ([Edmondson 1999:354](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GCFY8NFT?page=5))

> "a sense of confidence that the team will not embarrass, reject, or punish someone for speaking up." ([Edmondson 1999:354](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GCFY8NFT?page=5))

> "Team psychological safety should facilitate learning behavior in work teams because it alleviates excessive concern about others' reactions to actions that have the potential for embarrassment or threat, which learning behaviors often have." ([Edmondson 1999:355](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GCFY8NFT?page=6))

> "people are very attentive to the tone and quality of social processes and are more willing to comply with these when they feel valued (Tyler and Lind, 1992)." ([Edmondson 1999:355](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GCFY8NFT?page=6))

How would this relate to change management?

> "Hypothesis 2 (H2): Team psychological safety is positively associated with learning behavior in organizational work teams." ([Edmondson 1999:355](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GCFY8NFT?page=6))

> "Hypothesis 3 (H3): Team learning behavior mediates between team psychological safety and team performance" ([Edmondson 1999:355](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GCFY8NFT?page=6))

> "Hypothesis 4 (H4): Team efficacy is positively associated with team learning behavior." ([Edmondson 1999:356](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GCFY8NFT?page=7))

> "Team members deciding whether to reveal errors they have made are likely to be motivated to speak up if two conditions are satisfied: first, they believe they will not be rejected (team psychological safety) and, second, they believe that the team is capable of using this new information to generate useful results (team efficacy)" ([Edmondson 1999:356](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GCFY8NFT?page=7))

> "Hypothesis 5 (H5): Team efficacy is positively associated with team learning behavior, controlling for the effects of team psychological safety." ([Edmondson 1999:356](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GCFY8NFT?page=7))

> "A set of structural features-consisting of a clear compelling team goal, an enabling team design (including context support such as adequate resources, information, and rewards), along with team leader behaviors such as coaching and direction setting-have been shown to increase team effectiveness (Hackman, 1987; Wageman, 1998)." ([Edmondson 1999:356](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GCFY8NFT?page=7))

> "A team leader's behavior is particularly salient; team members are likely to attend to each other's actions and responses but to be particularly aware of the behavior of the leader (Tyler and Lind, 1992)" ([Edmondson 1999:356](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GCFY8NFT?page=7))

> "Hypothesis 6 (H6): Team leader coaching and context support are positively associated with team psychological safety." ([Edmondson 1999:356](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GCFY8NFT?page=7))

> "Hypothesis 7 (H7): Team psychological safety mediates between the antecedents of team leader coaching and context support and the outcome of team learning behavior." ([Edmondson 1999:357](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GCFY8NFT?page=8))

> "Hypothesis 8 (H8): Team efficacy mediates between the antecedents of team leader coaching and context support and the outcome of team learning behavior." ([Edmondson 1999:357](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GCFY8NFT?page=8))

> "mance, supporting HI (model 1)." ([Edmondson 1999:366](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GCFY8NFT?page=17))

> "Thus, of seven alternative models, team learning behavior accounts for the most variance in observer-rated team performance, providing support for HI." ([Edmondson 1999:366](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GCFY8NFT?page=17))

> "Overall, the study shows the usefulness of the construct of team psychological safety for understanding collective learning processes." ([Edmondson 1999:375](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GCFY8NFT?page=26))

> "The data also suggest that team psychological safety is something beyond interpersonal trust; there was evidence of a coherent interpersonal climate within each group characterized by the absence or presence of a blend of trust, respect for each other's competence, and caring about each other as people." ([Edmondson 1999:375](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GCFY8NFT?page=26))

> "The relationship between team psychological safety and learning behavior received substantial empirical support." ([Edmondson 1999:375](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GCFY8NFT?page=26))

> "a lack of psychological safety contributed to reluctance to ask for help" ([Edmondson 1999:375](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GCFY8NFT?page=26))

> "team psychological safety affects learning behavior, which in turn affects team performance." ([Edmondson 1999:376](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GCFY8NFT?page=27))

> "Two hypotheses-that team efficacy would be associated with learning behavior when controlling for team psychological safety and that team efficacy mediates the effect of context support and leader behavior on team learning-were not supported." ([Edmondson 1999:376](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GCFY8NFT?page=27))

> "at engaging in learning behavior in a team is highly dependent on team psychological safety-" ([Edmondson 1999:376](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GCFY8NFT?page=27))

> "one of the most striking results is the degree to which the proposed relationship between team psychological safety and team learning behavior received consistent empirical support across several analyses and independent measures." ([Edmondson 1999:376](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GCFY8NFT?page=27))

> "the conclusion that team psychological safety fosters team learning behavior is both consistent with existing organizational learning theory and has a certain degree of face validity; that is, the juxtaposition of team members' descriptions of the interpersonal context in their team with their stories of learning behavior is not a surprising one." ([Edmondson 1999:376](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GCFY8NFT?page=27))

> "But the fact that the two other publications teams in the survey sample had higher levels of learning demonstrates that the degree of task interdependence can be modified through learning behavior" ([Edmondson 1999:377](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GCFY8NFT?page=28))

> "team psychological safety is a mechanism that mediates between effective team design and learning behavior. Effective team leader coaching and context support, such as access to information and resources, appear to contribute to, but not to fully shape, an environment in which team members can develop shared beliefs that well-intentioned interpersonal risks will not be punished, and these beliefs enable team members to take proactive learning-oriented action, which in turn fosters effective performance." ([Edmondson 1999:377](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GCFY8NFT?page=28))
