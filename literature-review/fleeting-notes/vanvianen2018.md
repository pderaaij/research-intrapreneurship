## Abstract

This review addresses the three basic principles of person–environment ﬁt theory: (a) The person and the environment together predict human behavior better than each of them does separately; (b) outcomes are most optimal when personal attributes (e.g., needs, values) and environmental attributes (e.g., supplies, values) are compatible, irrespective of whether these attributes are rated as low, medium, or high; and (c) the direction of misﬁt between the person and the environment does not matter. My review of person–job and person–organization ﬁt research that used polynomial regression to establish ﬁt effects provides mixed support for the explanatory power of ﬁt. Individuals report most optimal outcomes when there is ﬁt on attributes they rate as highest, and they report lowest outcomes when the environment offers less than they need or desire. Linking these ﬁndings to individuals’ abilities and opportunities to adapt, I reconsider ﬁt theory and outline options for future research and practice.

> “Person–environment fit (hereafter fit) is generally defined as the compatibility between individuals and their environment.” (Vianen, 2018, p. 76)

> “The reality, however, is that a perfect fit seldom exists, as people make suboptimal choices and individuals and their environments change over time. In particular, the current economy and related changes in organizations force employees into situations that they may not have desired at first, which may cause an increase in misfits at work (Vogel et al. 2016).” (Vianen, 2018, p. 76)

> “Fit theories are built on three basic principles. First, fit theories (e.g., Schneider 1987) claim that fit is a more powerful predictor of individual outcomes (e.g., job satisfaction) than either of its components (the person and the environment) alone. Second, fit theory proposes that outcomes are most optimal when personal attributes (e.g., needs, abilities, values) and environmental attributes (e.g., supplies, demands, values) are compatible regardless of the level of these attributes. That is, individuals with low, medium, and high attributes are expected to respond similarly to situations of fit. Third, fit theories postulate that discrepancies between personal and environmental attributes (misfits) reduce positive outcomes irrespective of the direction of the discrepancies. That is, individuals with low, medium, and high attributes are assumed to respond similarly negatively to comparable levels of experienced deficiency (the environment offers less than the individual needs) and excess (the environment offers more than the individual needs).” (Vianen, 2018, p. 76)

> “Fit theory assumes that people have an innate need to fit their environments and to seek out environments that match their own characteristics. Individuals strive to fit because they generally prefer consistency, wish to exert control over their life and to reduce uncertainty, have a need to belong, and want happiness and life satisfaction (Yu 2013).” (Vianen, 2018, p. 77)

> “Fit allows individuals to better understand the behaviors of others and facilitates interpersonal interactions (Edwards & Cable 2009). Finally, people have a fundamental need to belong (e.g., Deci & Ryan 2000), and because of this need, they compare themselves with other people in the social environment.” (Vianen, 2018, p. 77)

> “Fit can take two forms: Individual and environmental attributes are similar (e.g., individual values match with those of the organization) or individual attributes are complemented by the organizational environment (e.g., individual skills are complemented by those of other team members) and vice versa. The fit literature conceptualizes these two forms of compatibility as supplementary and complementary fit, respectively (Kristof-Brown et al. 2005).” (Vianen, 2018, p. 77)

> “While person–vocation fit seems less important for job satisfaction, it does relate moderately positively to task performance and organizational citizenship behavior and negatively to counterproductive work behavior (Nye et al. 2017, Van Iddekinge et al. 2011).” (Vianen, 2018, p. 78)

> “The TWA posits that a satisfying job is the result of individual and organizational adjustments intended to create correspondence between individual and environmental attributes.” (Vianen, 2018, p. 78) TWA: Theories of Work Adjustment

> “Several studies have provided evidence that needs–supplies and demands–abilities misfits cause strain (Hecht & Allen 2005, Yang et al. 2008a).” (Vianen, 2018, p. 79)

> “Furthermore, while both of these fits relate to job attitudes (satisfaction, commitment, and intentions to quit), needs–supplies fit has the greatest impact on job attitudes (Kristof-Brown et al. 2005).” (Vianen, 2018, p. 79)

> “Demand–abilities fit seems relatively more important for performance and less important for job attitudes and strain because employees may tend to overestimate their abilities and demands–abilities fit as to preserve their self-esteem (Cable & DeRue 2002), and their personality characteristics (e.g., optimism, locus of control, self-efficacy) may mitigate the mental consequences of misfit (Park et al. 2012).” (Vianen, 2018, p. 79)

> “Person–organization fit is generally established by comparing personal values with those of the organization. Personal values are “abstract beliefs about desirable, trans-situational goals that serve as guiding principles in people’s lives” (Vecchione et al. 2016, p. 111).” (Vianen, 2018, p. 80)

> “Person–team fit refers to the match between the person and their immediate coworkers in terms of demographics, values, goals, personality, and skills.” (Vianen, 2018, p. 80)

> “Person–supervisor fit refers to the match between employees’ characteristics and those of their supervisor. Supervisors are important for employees because they can provide rewards and career opportunities. Moreover, supervisors transmit organizational values to the daily work environment (Schein 2004) and thus shape their employees’ environmental experiences through their own values and actions.” (Vianen, 2018, p. 80)

> “Taken together, fit research seems to support the contentions that individuals strive toward fit and that fit is associated with positive individual outcomes. Fit relates most strongly to attitudinal outcomes (e.g., satisfaction) and less strongly to behavioral outcomes (e.g., performance, turnover, job choice).” (Vianen, 2018, p. 81)

> “Furthermore, the strength of the fit–outcome relationship varies by fit domain. Person–job fit relates most strongly to job satisfaction, career satisfaction, and occupational commitment; person–organization fit relates most strongly to organizational commitment, organizational identification, and perceived support; person–team fit relates particularly strongly to attitudes toward peers; and person–supervisor fit relates most strongly to attitudes regarding the supervisor (Van Vianen et al. 2016).” (Vianen, 2018, p. 81)

> “Fit theory is rooted in Lewin’s (1951) notion that behavior (B) is a function of the person (P) and the environment (E), expressed as B = f(P,E). Fit theory proposes that the fit between the person and the environment rather than the person and the environment separately predicts human behavior.” (Vianen, 2018, p. 82)

> “With regard to personal factors, research has demonstrated that personality traits (e.g., big five traits, positive and negative affectivity, locus of control) impact employee job satisfaction (e.g., Judge et al. 2002), subjective well-being (e.g., Steel et al. 2008), and performance (e.g., Judge & Bono 2001). Additionally, significant relationships were found between employee’s value orientations and job attitudes (e.g., Vansteenkiste et al. 2007).” (Vianen, 2018, p. 84)

> “These studies did not find relationships between innovation fit and outcomes (Choi & Price 2005) or between creativity fit and outcomes (Livingstone et al. 1997).” (Vianen, 2018, p. 85)

> “Fit theory posits that fit is associated with positive outcomes regardless of whether the attributes of the person and the environment are low, medium, or high in absolute terms. However, it is possible that fit on extreme (low or high) personal attributes may result in higher outcomes than fit on neutral attributes because extreme scores reflect the strength of one’s needs and values.” (Vianen, 2018, p. 86)

> “Although several person–job fit studies have shown positive fit outcomes at all levels of personal attributes, many studies found significant slopes of the fit lines, indicating that most optimal outcomes occur when personal and environmental attributes are both high.” (Vianen, 2018, p. 88)

> “Thus, outcomes tend to be high when there is fit, particularly when individuals experience fit on high personal needs. These findings provide partial support for fit theory and prospect and regulatory focus theories. Most likely, the fit level at which outcomes are most optimal will depend on the specific attribute under study.” (Vianen, 2018, p. 88)

> “Fit theory proposes that positive and negative discrepancies between personal and environmental attributes impact outcomes equally negatively. A positive discrepancy or deficiency occurs when personal attributes are greater than environmental attributes, whereas a negative discrepancy or excess occurs when personal attributes are less than environmental attributes.” (Vianen, 2018, p. 89)

> “Altogether, fit theory posits negative outcomes of misfit irrespective of whether personal attributes are higher (deficiency) or lower (excess) than environmental attributes, whereas prospect and regulatory focus theories suggest that excess results in lower outcomes than deficiency. According to fit theory, outcomes will be lowest at the two extreme points of the misfit line, thus when misfit is largest, i.e., when the personal attribute is extremely high and the environmental attribute is extremely low or when the personal attribute is extremely low and the environmental attribute is extremely high (Figure 1, left and right corners).” (Vianen, 2018, p. 89)

> “Several person–organization fit studies (e.g., Vogel et al. 2016) showed that (a) outcomes were most negative at extreme levels of misfit, (b) positive outcomes increased with decreasing deficiency, and (c) positive outcomes increased with decreasing excess. However, other person–organization fit studies reported that outcomes were most negative at high levels of personal attributes and low levels of organizational attributes, reflecting extreme deficiency or nongain.” (Vianen, 2018, p. 90)

> “First, although there is evidence for the incremental value of fit (proposition 1), organizational attributes are also independently associated with individual outcomes and to a greater extent than personal attributes.” (Vianen, 2018, p. 90)

> “Third, deficiency and excess misfit can be equally harmful (proposition 3), but the fit studies included in this review reveal that deficiency tends to be more harmful than excess. Moreover, depending on the fit attribute under study, excess can be as beneficial as fit.” (Vianen, 2018, p. 91)

> “These findings partly support fit theory, but do not support prospect and regulatory focus theories proposing that loss (i.e., excess misfit on low personal attributes) results in more harmful outcomes than nongain (i.e., deficiency misfit on high personal attributes).” (Vianen, 2018, p. 91)

> “In reality, however, optimal fit seldom exists, cannot be realized, and may even undermine the human capacity to learn, develop, and adapt, as discrepancies tend to motivate people to move (e.g., Bandura 1991).” (Vianen, 2018, p. 91)

> “Fit theory is built on the notion that people vary in their needs and values and that environments should therefore match these varying attributes. However, fit perceptions likely concern two different types of attributes: attributes that are generally desirable and those that are uniquely desirable by only some individuals” (Vianen, 2018, p. 93)

> “Finally, despite differences in fit attributes and outcomes, the majority of person–organization fit studies showed that fit on high personal values resulted in highest individual outcomes, whereas fit on low personal values were often as detrimental as misfits.” (Vianen, 2018, p. 94)

> “In addition, fit researchers mostly employ an interindividual approach, assessing individuals on a similar set of fit attributes. However, the set of attributes may not incorporate the needs and values that matter. Future research could use an intraindividual approach in which individuals report their main interests, needs, and values or those of the environment” (Vianen, 2018, p. 94)

> “When experiencing misfit, individuals will try to adapt to it.” (Vianen, 2018, p. 95)

> “Adaptation may include the typical regulatory strategies uncovered by research on self-regulation and coping, such as thoughts or actions to change the self or the situation (e.g., Larsen & Prizmic 2004).” (Vianen, 2018, p. 95)

> “Regarding the content of misfits, this review has shown that some misfits are more detrimental for a person’s well-being or functioning than others. Demands–abilities and vocational misfits seem relatively easier to cope with than needs–supplies misfits.” (Vianen, 2018, p. 95)

> “Apparently, misfits with regard to one’s most fundamental needs and values are difficult to deal with. These misfits may motivate individuals to leave the job rather than trying to cognitively or actually change the self or the environment. This may occur particularly when there are no opportunities to change the environment by, for example, crafting the content of one’s job.” (Vianen, 2018, p. 95)

> “In less formalized contexts, misfit tends to induce proactive behaviors to create better-fitting work experiences (Yu & Davis 2016).” (Vianen, 2018, p. 95)

> “Thus, to enhance employees’ fit while also retaining sufficient diversity in the workforce, organizations could offer employees a certain freedom to craft their jobs (see the fifth suggestion for practice in the sidebar titled Suggestions for Research and Practice) and select applicants who are capable of proactively coping with misfits (Vogel et al. 2016).” (Vianen, 2018, p. 95)

> “Employees with higher core self-evaluations (a combination of high self-esteem, self-efficacy, and locus of control and low neuroticism) react more strongly to fits and misfits than employees with low core self-evaluations (De Haas & Van Eerde 2015). That is, employees who have a positive self-image report more positive job attitudes when experiencing fit but also stronger negative job attitudes when experiencing misfit than employees who have a less positive self-image. Employees with high core self-evaluations may perceive misfit as a threat to their self-image, which may trigger adaptation responses such as efforts to change the work environment or to find another” (Vianen, 2018, p. 95)

> “Seeking feedback may help individuals to better cope with misfit by putting effort into learning or adjusting to the job demands.” (Vianen, 2018, p. 96)

> “In practice, organizations could assess whether applicants tend to respond proactively to misfits” (Vianen, 2018, p. 96)
