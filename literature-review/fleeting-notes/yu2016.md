> “Proactive behaviour is the anticipatory self-initiated effort to bring about change in one’s work environment and/or the self (Grant & Ashford, 2008).” (Yu and Davis, 2016, p. 172)

> “In today’s dynamic and uncertain global economy, more people are beginning to subscribe to the notion that organizations may gain a competitive advantage when they have employees who engage in proactive behaviours (Thomas, Whitman, & Viswesvaran, 2010).” (Yu and Davis, 2016, p. 172)

> “freedom and discretion to determine how one’s job is performed, as a key antecedent of proactive behaviours (Hackman & Oldham, 1976; Morgeson & Humphrey, 2006).” (Yu and Davis, 2016, p. 173)

> “However, it is less clear whether it is the individual need for autonomy on the part of newcomers (Ashford & Black, 1996), or the provision of autonomy through employer job design (Grant & Ashford, 2008) that is crucial to understanding proactive behaviour among these individuals. Unfortunately, individual and environmental factors have seldom been investigated together as joint predictors of proactive behaviour.” (Yu and Davis, 2016, p. 173) In other words, is it the need for autonomy or the presence to take autonomy that will lead to proactive behaviour

> “Ashford and Black’s (1996) influential study identified seven key types of change-oriented proactive behaviours that organizational newcomers engage in. These include feedback seeking, information seeking, job change negotiation, positive framing, general socializing, building relationships with the boss, and networking.” (Yu and Davis, 2016, p. 173)

> “Ashford and Black’s (1996) study also revealed that most of these behaviours were motivated by the newcomer’s desire for control. The transition from outsider to employee is often fraught with uncertainty where individuals are faced with numerous task, social, and cultural demands (Miller & Jablin, 1991).” (Yu and Davis, 2016, p. 174)

> “which often manifests itself in a felt need for autonomy over what, when, and how one’s job should be performed (de Rijk, Le Blanc, Schaufeli, & De Jonge, 1998; Ryan & Deci, 2000; Vansteenkiste et al., 2007). This need for autonomy motivates proactive behaviours that are designed to gain control over the novel work environment and promote successful coping and adaptation (Ashford & Black, 1996).” (Yu and Davis, 2016, p. 174)

> “An alternative job environment-based view treats autonomy as part of job design and something that is provided by an organization or managers (Hackman & Oldham, 1976; Morgeson & Humphrey, 2006). Such situational autonomy signals to newcomers that they have the ability and opportunity to act proactively by exerting initiative to manage their jobs and develop their skills (Axtell & Parker, 2003; Morrison, 2006; Parker, Williams, & Turner, 2006; Wrzesniewski & Dutton, 2001).” (Yu and Davis, 2016, p. 174)

> “Our current approach is based on a PE fit framework because it facilitates enquiry on how the quality of relationships between individuals and their environments (i.e., fit) jointly impacts outcomes such as proactive behaviour (Edwards, 1994).” (Yu and Davis, 2016, p. 174)

> “A PE fit framework integrates these two perspectives by showing how proactive behaviour varies according to the extent to which individual needs are met by organizational supplies for autonomy. Specifically, PE fit theory refers to such relationships focusing on how personal needs are satisfied by job environment supplies as needs–supplies (NS) fit (Kristof, 1996).” (Yu and Davis, 2016, p. 174)

> “There are two opposing views towards the exact nature of how proactive behaviour varies according to the extent of autonomy-based NS fit. According to an affective-consistency-based view, NS fit will lead to more proactive behaviours. This is because NS fit gives rise to positive attitudes which in turn act as motivators for newcomer proactive behaviour.” (Yu and Davis, 2016, p. 174)

> “Thus, experiencing positive feelings towards a job causes one to seek more feedback and information on job tasks as a means to excel at a job that he or she values (Ashford, Blatt, & Walle, 2003; Wanberg & Kammeyer-Mueller, 2000).” (Yu and Davis, 2016, p. 175)

> “In all, the affective-consistency view advocates a relationship where levels of the above types of newcomer proactive behaviours are highest when NS fit exists and employers provide a level of autonomy that satisfies individual needs.” (Yu and Davis, 2016, p. 175)

> “An alternative relationship is predicted by a self-regulatory view which argues that newcomer proactive behaviours are highest when there is NS misfit. Self-regulation describes individuals as active managers of PE fit who are motivated to achieve PE fit through proactive behaviour (Edwards, 1992; Yu, 2009)” (Yu and Davis, 2016, p. 175)

> “Such a view implies that the impetus to engage in proactive behaviour is highest when there is misfit and organizational supplies diverge from individual needs” (Yu and Davis, 2016, p. 175)

> “Organizations can provide either insufficient autonomy to satisfy individual needs, or too much autonomy so that it exceeds the amount that the individual needs.” (Yu and Davis, 2016, p. 175)

> “Negative affect characterized by feelings of unhappiness and dissatisfaction emerges when individuals receive too little autonomy relative to what they desire (Edwards, Caplan, & Harrison, 1998; Locke, 1969; Taris & Feij, 2001). Such feelings signal that the current situation is problematic and informs individuals that their current work setting and PE fit is undesirable. As a coping mechanism, newcomers are thus motivated to engage in proactive behaviours to correct the situation of NS misfit.” (Yu and Davis, 2016, p. 175)> “Thus, newcomers may try to negotiate with their superiors for more freedom and discretion over job tasks when they feel that they lack autonomy (Hornung, Rousseau, & Glaser, 2008).” (Yu and Davis, 2016, p. 175)

> “Needs–supplies misfit also exists when there is an oversupply of autonomy that exceeds individual needs. Such a situation may be associated with a perceived lack of guidance on the job, which causes newcomers to proactively seek feedback and information regarding job tasks (Ashford, 1986).” (Yu and Davis, 2016, p. 176)

> “Lastly, positive framing can also be employed for both situations of NS misfit, where newcomers effectively bias and calibrate their perceptions of the self and the environment to deal with the negative affect accompanying the experience of misfit (Folkman & Moskowitz, 2004).” (Yu and Davis, 2016, p. 176)

> “Therefore, in contrast to the affective-consistency perspective, a self-regulatory view argues that newcomer proactive behaviours are highest when NS misfit exists and there is either an under- or oversupply of autonomy relative to individual newcomer needs” (Yu and Davis, 2016, p. 176)

> “Perhaps the most complete framework for such information was proposed by Morrison (1995) who integrated several existing typologies to identify the following types of information that are relevant for the successful socialization of newcomers: Technical (e.g., how to perform required tasks), referent (e.g., requirements and expectations associated with the job role), appraisal (e.g., how one’s behaviour will be evaluated), social (e.g., relationships with and between coworkers), normative (e.g., firm culture), organizational (e.g., firm’s structure, procedures, products and services), and political (e.g., distribution of power within the firm). It follows that linking proactive behaviour to socialization outcomes involves understanding the types of information yielded by different types of newcomer proactive behaviours and how such information impacts each type of outcome.” (Yu and Davis, 2016, p. 176)

> “Edwards, Cable, Williamson, Lambert, & Shipp (2006) have identified three types of PE fit measures: Molar, molecular, and atomistic.” (Yu and Davis, 2016, p. 179)

> “Therefore, there was support for hypothesis 2’s argument that proactivity was highest when misfit existed between needs and supplies. Furthermore, all forms of proactive behaviours except for job change negotiation were highest when there was too much autonomy, indicating no support for hypothesis 1. This finding also implies that proactive behaviours were generally highest when there was an oversupply of autonomy that exceeded individual needs.” (Yu and Davis, 2016, p. 183)

> “This method enabled us to precisely conclude that the levels of newcomer proactive behaviours also varied according to the form of misfit, where proactivity was higher when there was an oversupply of autonomy compared to when there was an undersupply. Such differences highlight the importance of paying closer attention to different forms of misfit.” (Yu and Davis, 2016, p. 189)

> “The finding that positive framing was a consistent predictor and mediator across all socialization outcomes highlights the importance of currently overlooked cognitive approaches to proactive behaviours. Indeed researchers need to question whether proactive behaviours lie strictly within the boundaries of action-related behaviours. Such an approach may limit a deeper understanding of the dynamics and multifaceted nature of proactive behaviours as more recent theoretical work has emphasized crucial cognitive processes such as anticipation and planning that may operate prior to and during the engagement of proactive behaviours (Grant & Ashford, 2008; Parker & Collins, 2010).” (Yu and Davis, 2016, p. 189)

> “Practically, these results also imply that employers looking to manage proactive behaviours through the provision of job autonomy need to be aware that NS fit might actually discourage newcomers from engaging in proactive behaviours, which might in turn have an unwanted negative impact on socialization outcomes. Instead of focusing on satisfying individual needs for autonomy, it may be beneficial for employers to create and encourage a job environment in which proactive behaviours can emerge. In this sense, employers may consider other ways of encouraging newcomer adaptation and proactive engagement such as institutionalized socialization tactics (Ashforth et al., 2007), and facilitating socializing and networking opportunities across different organizational groups to improve newcomers’ access to social capital that can facilitate their adaptation (Fang et al., 2011).” (Yu and Davis, 2016, p. 190)
