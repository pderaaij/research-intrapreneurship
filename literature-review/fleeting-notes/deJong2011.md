> “IB is proposed to be a higher-order construct reflected in three dimensions: innovativeness, proactiveness and risk-taking”

> “IB is associated with proactive personality, educational attainment, job autonomy and job types (managers and sales people are more likely to be intrapreneurs)”

> “'Intrapreneurship' is one of the labels used for corporate entrepreneurship, i.e. entrepreneurship within organizations (Sharma and Chrisman, 1999)”

> “The term was coined by Gifford Pinchot (1987) who identified intrapreneurs as 'in-house entrepreneurs, those dreamers who can increase the speed and cost-effectiveness of technology transfer from R&D to the marketplace' (p.14).”

> “We define intrapreneurial behavior (IB) as the identification and exploitation of opportunities by individual workers that (also) advance the organization.”

> “When researchers apply the term 'intrapreneurship' it is usually refers to individual workers rather than organizations or boardroom-level decision makers (e.g., Pinchot, 1987; Stevenson and Jarillo, 1990; Antoncic and Hisrich, 2003). In this paper we adopt this point of view. We regard corporate entrepreneurship as a firm-level and topdown process that business owners and general managers can engage in to foster new ventures, innovations and strategic renewal (cf. Sharma and Chrisman, 1999).”

> “Conversely, we regard intrapreneurship as a bottom-up process marked by the initiation and implementation of activities by individual workers to explore and exploit business opportunities.”

There is a difference between corporate entrepreneurship and intrapreneurship. The latter is bottom-up oriented and focuses on the activitties and behaviours of individual employees.Corporate entrepreneurship is about (planned) actions undertaken by owners and c-level to innovate, start new ventures and strategic renewal

> “Pinchot defined intrapreneurs as 'those who take hands-on responsibility for creating innovation of any kind within an organization; they may be the creators or inventors but are always the dreamers who figure out how to turn an idea into a profitable reality'”

> “Here, however, we argue that the innovativeness dimension is broader than new products or services. It may also include process-related innovations to bring new or improved production o”

> “6 marketing methods, or to apply new kinds of resources. To be part of IB, innovations may include any opportunity deviating from the status quo that would also advance the organization.”

> “Innovative work behavior is then defined as individual's behavior aiming to achieve the initiation and intentional introduction (within a work role, group or organization) of new and useful ideas, processes, products or procedures (Farr and Ford, 1990)”

> “In the CE literature, proactiveness is an opportunity-seeking, forward-looking perspective characterized by high awareness of external trends and events and acting in anticipation thereof (Rauch et al., 2009)”

> “Pinchot (1985) described intrapreneurs as those who may get in trouble because they go beyond formal job descriptions. Vesper (1984) defined intrapreneurship as 'employee initiative from below in the organization to undertake something new, i.e. an innovation which is created by subordinates without being asked, expected, or perhaps even given permission by higher management to do so' (p.295).”

> “Proactive behavior is defined as 'self-initiated and future-oriented action that aims to change and improve the situation or oneself' (Parker, Williams and Turner, 2006: p.636)”

> “Person/environment fit behaviors are excluded as they primarily emphasize developing the self.”

> “n the CE literature, risk-taking involves taking bold actions by venturing into the unknown, borrowing heavily, and/or committing significant resources to ventures in unknown environments (Rauch et al., 2009: p.763)”

> “In sum, at the individual level risk-taking is implicitly present in many of the related constructs that have been proposed”

> “Nevertheless, as an intrapreneur pursues opportunities and consequently operates in uncertain environments, some risk-taking will be part of his/her behavior by default.”

> “H1 Innovativeness, proactiveness and risk-taking reflect a higher-order construct.”

> “H2 Intrapreneurial behavior is positively related with, but distinct from (a) job performance, (b) feedback seeking.”

> “H3 The relationship between intrapreneurial behavior and... ...(a) proactive personality is positive ...(b) educational attainment is positive ...(c) age is an inverted U-shape ...(d) tenure is positive.”

> “In support, de Jong and den Hartog (2010) found that the more external work contacts, the better knowledge workers were rated by their supervisors on their innovative work behavior.”

> “Similarly, Perry-Smith and Shalley (2003) suggested that those having more diverse networks (with more weak ties) are more exposed to non-redundant information, and this would facilitate deviant behaviors like opportunity exploration and championing ideas.”

> “Sales people often fail to make a deal, and need to be persistent and accept losses (of their time and resources) in order to succeed. As a consequence, they can be anticipated to be more proactive and willing to take risks.”

> “H4 The relationship between intrapreneurial behavior and... ...(a) job autonomy, (b) job variety, (c) being a manager, (d) being a sales worker, and (e) being full-time employed is positive.”

> “In this paper we developed a new measure for individuals' intrapreneurial behavior (IB), defined as the identification and exploitation of opportunities by individual workers to (also) advance the organization, and reflected in their innovative, proactive and risk-taking behaviors.”

> “We emphasize that IB is a higher-order construct that becomes visible in a simultaneous presence of innovativeness, proactiveness and risk-taking. Although highly correlated, their interrelationships are not deterministic and none can by itself be regarded as intrapreneurial behavior.”

> “When aimed for a better person/environment fit, proactive behaviors are not considered intrapreneurial.”

> “We also analyzed how IB is associated with various individual and contextual variables. Although this analysis is only a first step, our results can be helpful to identify potential intrapreneurs and to develop better and more focused interventions.”

> “For the individual-level variables proactive personality was one of them, implying that IB is partly explained by a dispositional trait and accordingly difficult to intervene on. The most obvious intervention would be to account for proactive personality when recruiting new workers.”

> “This finding stresses the importance of workers' cognitive development, and suggests a number of potential interventions. If their most highly-educated staff members would refrain from intrapreneurship, managers should start to wonder why.”

> “Another finding was that the relationship between age and IB is an inverted U, implying that middle-aged workers are generally regarded as more intrapreneurial than their younger and elder colleagues.”

> “This suggests that both workers' motivation and perceived capabilities are influential. For managers this would imply that lower expectations with regard to intrapreneurial behavior are justified for their most junior workers (due to lack of capability) and the most senior ones (because of diminished motivation). Note however that the role of and interaction between motivation and capability is only assumed here, and future research into this matter is recommended (see hereafter).”

> “Our study of job-context variables stressed the significance of job types. It was confirmed that managers are more likely to be intrapreneurs, echoing past studies in which middle-managers were assumed to be prime sources of intra-company entrepreneurial activities (e.g., Hornsby et al., 2009).”

> “Moreover, we found that sales workers were more intrapreneurial. Note that in previous studies this group of workers has been overlooked. Sales workers are generally better connected with external need sources, enjoy high autonomy, and they generally need to be proactive and take risks in order to succeed.”

> “Another finding was that job autonomy was directly related with IB, while job variety was only related when autonomy was left out of the equation. As both constructs are related, we regard this finding as evidence that job design matters for bottom-up opportunity pursuit, providing top managers with an object for intervention.”

> “Besides, autonomy implies that workers get involved in higher level decision-making tasks, which is generally a source of new mastery experiences and will enhance IB. In contradiction, job variety is usually concerned with taking on a prescribed set of extra tasks, and not necessarily marked by increased motivation or mastery experiences (cf. Parker, 1998).”

> “We noticed that previous studies on the dimensions of IB, especially on individual innovation and proactive behaviors, seem to implicitly assume that any person is capable of recognizing and exploiting opportunities. Our results however suggest that top managers should differentiate their expectations. Employees seem more likely to engage in IB if they are better educated, middle-aged, and hold managerial and/or sales positions.”
