## Abstract

## Notes

> “Our focus is on job design variables, or the structure, content, and configuration of employees’ tasks and roles (Parker & Ohly, 2008)”

> “We investigate the potential influence of job autonomy and job variety, two job design variables which strongly influence employees’ general work satisfaction and performance. Job autonomy and variety correspond with important potential interventions to expand jobs vertically (increase responsibility for decision making) or horizontally (breadth of activities people are involved in), respectively (Parker, 1998).”

> “We suggest that dichotomous indicators like engagement in new firm formation and/or self-employment are not suitable to explore employees’ entrepreneurial behavior.”

> “We define entrepreneurial behavior as the extent to which individual workers proactively engage in the creation, introduction, and application of opportunities at work, marked by taking business-related risks. Behavior-based perspectives of entrepreneurship generally revolve around similar definitions: associated with the discovery, evaluation, and exploitation of opportunities (Shane, 2003).”

> “Given our broad, behavior-based definition, we identified three features of entrepreneurial behavior for investigation: innovation, proactivity, and risk taking.”

> “Likewise, entrepreneurial orientation studies generally regard innovativeness as a central characteristic of an entrepreneurial organization. Innovativeness is then defined as “a predisposition to engage in creativity and experimentation through the introduction of new products””

> “For independent entrepreneurs, despite their inclination to minimize risks, opportunity pursuit is marked by uncertainty “as time, effort and resources must be invested before the distribution of their returns is known” (Shane, 2003, p. 7).”

> “While material losses would be partly or fully passed on to their employers, entrepreneurial workers may face reputation damage, resistance from peers, and even losing their job. In this respect, Gasse (1982) identified that beyond material assets, entrepreneurial risk also involves psychological, social, and/or personal matters.”

> “In all, we associate risk taking with facing potential losses in a broader sense, and with an inclination to move forward without a priori permission or consensus.”

> “The design of a job includes a variety of task, knowledge, social, and contextual characteristics (Morgeson & Humphrey, 2006).”

> “Autonomy and variety correspond with two major job design interventions to improve employees’ satisfaction and effectiveness, that is, by increasing the vertical scope of a job (enhanced autonomy implying decision-making latitude) and its horizontal breadth (increased task variety) (Parker, 1998).”

> “Job autonomy is “the degree to which the job provides substantial freedom, independence, and discretion to the individual in scheduling the work and in determining the procedures to be used in carrying it out” (Hackman & Oldham, 1976, p. 258).”

> “Job autonomy enhances workers’ situational control beliefs: enabling them to determine independently how to do their job or tasks, which is associated with increased mastery experiences and more self-efficacy at work (Parker, 1998).”

> “Hypothesis 1: Job autonomy is positively related to entrepreneurial behaviors (innovation, proactivity, risk taking) in organizations.”

> “First, workers with more varied tasks are more likely to discover opportunities; that is, this usually happens at the intersection of diverse thought worlds, so that information asymmetries can be solved.”

> “job variety enables individuals to develop a broader range of capabilities and social ties which can be helpful to implement opportunities.”

> “Hypothesis 2: Job variety is positively related to entrepreneurial behaviors (innovation, proactivity, risk taking) in organizations.”

> “Three features of entrepreneurial behavior were identified: innovation, proactivity, and risk taking. Using data collected in a research and consultancy business, these behaviors appeared to be a higher-order construct, which was related-but-not-identical to individuals’ job performance, and positively and significantly related to workers’ self-rated entrepreneurial outputs and intentions to become self-employed 3 years after the initial data had been collected.”

> “We found that job autonomy was directly related with overall entrepreneurial behavior, as well as with its innovation and proactivity dimensions. Conversely, in spite of the positive bivariate correlations between job variety and entrepreneurial behaviors, job variety lost its significance when other variables were controlled for. Autonomy is probably more distinctive because it increases perceived control over the work environment which also enhances employees’ motivation or willingness to engage in such behaviors, while job variety supposedly only influences perceived capabilities for entrepreneurial behavior.”

> “On top of that, autonomy may imply that workers get involved in higher level decision-making tasks, which is generally a source of new mastery experiences, while job variety is usually concerned with taking on a prescribed set of extra tasks, and not necessarily marked by increased motivation or mastery experiences.”

> “In sum, we found that job design variables matter for entrepreneurial behavior in organizations in the sense that job autonomy makes a difference. However, a diverse impact was found when innovation, proactivity, and risk taking were considered separately. More specifically, for risk-taking behavior both job design variables were insignificant.”
