## Abstract

Intrapreneurial employees and intrapreneurial projects are considered to be an important driver of innovation and strategic renewal within companies. While many studies addressed the top-down implementation of innovative projects, analyses of employee initiatives in promoting innovation within companies are scarce. This paper therefore takes a bottom-up approach and focuses on employee behaviour and how it can be stimulated towards intrapreneurship. We propose and test a two-step model where formal and informal work context affects employees’ intrapreneurial behaviour, which then provides the basis for bottom-up initiated intrapreneurial projects. Our empirical data consist of questionnaire responses of 176 employees in six Dutch companies. The results of structural equation model estimations indicate that formal organisational factors (horizontal participation, resource availability) affect employees’ intrapreneurial behaviour, but also highlight informal factors such as trust in the direct manager. We also find that innovativeness and personal initiative, but not risk taking, play a role for an effective translation of employees’ behaviour into intrapreneurial projects.

> “We propose and test a two-step model where formal and informal work context affects employees’ intrapreneurial behaviour, which then provides the basis for bottom-up initiated intrapreneurial projects.” (Rigtering and Weitzel, 2013, p. 337)

> “While some firms seem to have little problems in identifying and exploiting opportunities, others experience severe difficulties.” (Rigtering and Weitzel, 2013, p. 338)

> “Corporate entrepreneurship (CE), which is often also referred to as intrapreneurship, has, in this respect, become an increasingly important tool for practitioners to enhance a firm’s performance and to foster innovation and opportunity exploitation within a firm.” (Rigtering and Weitzel, 2013, p. 338)

> “Entrepreneurship within existing organisations can, however, be present at every level within the organisation (Kemelgor 2002; Monsen and Boss 2009) and the various manners in which entrepreneurial behaviour is exhibited across organisational levels can be considered as a main driver of the level of CE within a firm (Wales et al. 2011; Covin et al. 2006).” (Rigtering and Weitzel, 2013, p. 338)

> “For the purpose of this study we therefore distinguish between entrepreneurial activities that are initiated top-down by the organisation (CE), and entrepreneurial activities that are pursued bottom-up by employees within an organisation (intrapreneurship). Although a distinction between top-down and bottom-up initiated entrepreneurial activities is essential in order to acknowledge that there are different frame conditions for entrepreneurial behaviour at (top) management level and at the employee level (see e.g. Dess et al. 2003), the terms CE and intrapreneurship are often used interchangeably.” (Rigtering and Weitzel, 2013, p. 338)

> “An strong focus on CE does not automatically result in intrapreneurship (Burgelman 1983). Organisations, and large organisation in particular, are often not suitable environments for intrapreneurial behaviour (Sharma and Chrisman 1999) and disagreements between employer and employee are a major reason why many intrapreneurs leave their employer and start up an independent business (Klepper” (Rigtering and Weitzel, 2013, p. 338)

> “In a recent survey of the literature on intrapreneurship, Stam et al. (2012) identify six groups of important antecedents: dispositional traits, demography, cognitive abilities, job design, work context and broader environment. Of these antecedents, job design and work context are of particular interest for managers that seek to improve the level of CE within their organisation, as they can directly be influenced by organisational policies and managerial actions” (Rigtering and Weitzel, 2013, p. 339)

> “We therefore make a distinction between the formalized work context that can act as a catalyst or barrier to entrepreneurship (Zahra and Covin 1995; Burns 2008) and the informal work context of exchange relationships between the manager and employee.” (Rigtering and Weitzel, 2013, p. 339)

> “Within the model, a distinction is being made between employee level (intrapreneurship and intrapreneurial behaviours) and the organisational level (formal work context and informal work context).” (Rigtering and Weitzel, 2013, p. 340)

> “This definition characterizes an intrapreneur, in line with Bosma et al. (2012), as an employee that takes the lead in introducing and implementing innovations. It also highlights, consistent with Pinchot (1986), the importance of idea implementation and innovation in intrapreneurship.” (Rigtering and Weitzel, 2013, p. 340)

> “CE research at firm level usually conceptualizes CE as a set of innovative, proactive and risk taking behaviour (see e.g. Covin and Slevin 1989; Rauch et al.” (Rigtering and Weitzel, 2013, p. 340)

> “Social exchange therefore depends on trust and reciprocity within the exchange relationship as expectations about performance of a second party are often formulated a priori and related to outcome expectations as well as interpersonal treatment (Rousseau 1989).” (Rigtering and Weitzel, 2013, p. 342)

> “The use of social exchange within intrapreneurship research emphasizes that actions and decisions of individual employees should be seen in a relational context; in which the relationship between the manager, who acts on behave of the organisation, and the employee is of particular relevance. At the heart of this exchange relationship is the notion of trust.” (Rigtering and Weitzel, 2013, p. 342

> “Employees that exhibit intrapreneurial behaviour are, however, likely to bump into organisational inertia, bureaucracy, and other hurdles (Burgelman 1983;Chisholm1987).” (Rigtering and Weitzel, 2013, p. 342)

> “Thus, even though an intrapreneurial project may bare high potential for the company as a whole, the decision to opt for intrapreneurship remains an individual and personal decision when intrapreneurship is not a standard part of the job description of the employee.” (Rigtering and Weitzel, 2013, p. 342)

> “Therefore, from a process perspective, intrapreneurship is likely to follow a certain sequence. Employees first have to develop ideas and identify opportunities (intrapreneurial behaviour) before they can initiate and take the lead in innovative projects (intrapreneurship).” (Rigtering and Weitzel, 2013, p. 342)

> “H1: Employees that experience higher levels of horizontal and vertical participation, show more intrapreneurial behaviour H2: Employees that experience the organisational structure as highly formalized, display less intrapreneurial behaviour H3: Employees that have more resources available for innovative projects, show more intrapreneurial behaviour” (Rigtering and Weitzel, 2013, p. 343)

> “H4: Employees that have trust in their direct manager, show more intrapreneurial behaviour” (Rigtering and Weitzel, 2013, p. 343)

> “The relationship between formalisation and intrapreneurial behaviour is moderated by trust in the manager. Employees that trust their manager are less restricted in their intrapreneurial behaviour by high levels of formalization” (Rigtering and Weitzel, 2013, p. 344)

> “Employees with a higher level of intrapreneurial behaviour are more likely to be intrapreneurs” (Rigtering and Weitzel, 2013, p. 344)> “Employees with a higher level of intrapreneurial behaviour are involved in more important intrapreneurial projects” (Rigtering and Weitzel, 2013, p. 345)

> “The four main findings of this study are: (1) Intrapreneurship within organisations is not affected directly by the work context, but indirectly through innovative workplace behaviour and personal initiative by employees. (2) Formal organisational work context characteristics such as horizontal participation and the number of resources affect the level of innovative behaviours and personal initiative within an organisation, but not risk taking. (3) Trust in the direct manager plays an important role in the stimulation of innovative behaviours and personal initiative amongst employees. (4) Risk taking behaviour by employees is not related to the involvement in an intrapreneurial project.” (Rigtering and Weitzel, 2013, p. 354)

> “Although the predictive validity of innovative employee behaviour for intrapreneurship is confirmed in this study, our results also suggest that work context affects intrapreneurship only indirectly. This implies that policies aimed at improving the level of intrapreneurship within organisations through a change in formal and informal work context only have a limited impact, while they may be more successful in stimulating intrapreneurial behaviour amongst employees.” (Rigtering and Weitzel, 2013, p. 354)> “In line with previous research on CE (e.g. Hornsby et al. 2002;Morrisetal.2008), our results highlight that entrepreneurial behaviour within an organisation requires a formal work context that poses little constrains on employees (allows for horizontal participation) and provides support for the development innovative projects (resource availability). This result is also in line with intrapreneurship research by Zampetakis et al. (2009), who show that perceived organisational support affects the level of intrapreneurial behaviour by employees.” (Rigtering and Weitzel, 2013, p. 355)

> “In contrast to our expectations, no significant negative relationship between formalisation and intrapreneurial behaviour has been found. A closer examination of the relationship between employees that have low and high trust in their manager highlights, however, the complexity of the different relationships. Employees that do not trust their manager display lower levels of innovative workplace behaviour when working in highly formalized organisations. Employees that trust their manager are, on the other hand, not obstructed by high levels of formalization and show even more innovative workplace behaviour.” (Rigtering and Weitzel, 2013, p. 355)

> “In these situations, employees must be able to trust their direct supervisor that (s)he provides support in case things go wrong. Our research therefore provides initial support for the proposition of Dess et al. (2003) that social exchanges between managers and employees play an important role in the intrapreneurial process and, in a more general sense, reaffirms the key role of managers within CE as suggested by, e.g., Hornsby et al. (2002).” (Rigtering and Weitzel, 2013, p. 355) How does relate/interact with psychological safety?
