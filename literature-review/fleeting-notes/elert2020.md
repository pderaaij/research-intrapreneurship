## Abstract

Researchers increasingly recognize that entrepreneurial employees, intrapreneurs, play a critical role in innovation. As with regular entrepreneurship, however, the value of intrapreneurial activity depends on the firm-­specific and societal reward structures that intrapreneurs face. Ideally, these rules of the game are such that they reward intrapreneurship that is beneficial for the firm and the economy. When this is not the case, intrapreneurship can be beneficial for the firm but not for society, damaging for the firm yet beneficial for society, or downright non-­productive. We offer a taxonomy describing how society’s rules and firm rules interact to produce different intrapreneurial outcomes.

> “There is a growing recognition that entrepreneurial employees, or intrapreneurs, are part of the main cast in the story of innovation and economic growth.” (Elert and Stenkula, 2020, p. 1)

> “while Parker (2011, p. 19) defines intrapreneurship as “the practice of developing a new venture within an existing organization, to exploit a new opportunity and create economic value.”” (Elert and Stenkula, 2020, p. 1)

> “Existing research indicates that intrapreneurship may be as crucial for welfare in developed economies as independent entrepreneurship (Stam, 2013), and most researchers operate definitions that assume that intrapreneurship is unequivocally positive for society (a notable exception to which we will return is Foss et al., 2007).” (Elert and Stenkula, 2020, p. 1)

> “This positive impression is reinforced by anecdotal evidence of successful innovation resulting from employees’ creativity and initiative, rather than top-down decrees; examples are Google’s Gmail, 3M’s Post-it Notes, and Amazon’s Drones (Knippen, 2017; cf. Pongracic, 2009).” (Elert and Stenkula, 2020, p. 1)

> “Scholars within the intrapreneurship tradition focus on employees and how firm structure and culture affect their entrepreneurial activities.” (Elert and Stenkula, 2020, p. 2)

> “Here, intrapreneurship is commonly seen as a prerequisite for firms to change and survive in the long run.” (Elert and Stenkula, 2020, p. 2)

> “Since 2011, the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) measures country level intrapreneurship, defining intrapreneurs as individuals who continuously develop new business activities for their primary employer. The definition is representative in treating intrapreneurship as a productive endeavor in the sense that it increases the joint surplus, and should be encouraged.” (Elert and Stenkula, 2020, p. 2)

> “However, firms do not necessarily perceive intrapreneurship in a positive light. Analysis of 2,000 medium-sized tech-businesses suggests that intrapreneurs often end up in an adversarial role: “Intrapreneurs are very important to the company but they are seen as enemies because they question long-standing paradigms” (Baltes, 2016). But is a company always unwarranted in seeing the intrapreneur as an enemy? Not necessarily.” (Elert and Stenkula, 2020, p. 2)

> “Pinchot (1985), who coined the term, explicitly described intrapreneurs as “[t]hose who take hands-on responsibility for creating innovation of any kind, within a business.”” (Elert and Stenkula, 2020, p. 2)

> “Baumol (2010) estimates that more than nine tenths of the rise in GDP per capita since 1870 can be attributed to innovation.” (Elert and Stenkula, 2020, p. 2)

> “That said, wide-tent definitions of entrepreneurship successfully incorporate several aspects simultaneously; for example, Leyden and Link (2015) conceive of entrepreneurship as the (Schumpeterian) process of acquiring knowledge to produce innovations while dealing with (Knightian) uncertainty (for other widetent definitions, see Henrekson & Stenkula, 2016; Wennekers & Thurik, 1999).” (Elert and Stenkula, 2020, p. 3)

> “Even though researchers have embraced Baumol’s (1990) fundamental insight, among the few who draw the corresponding implications for intrapreneurship are Foss et al. (2007), who explore the idea that intrapreneurship can destroy value (see also Foss & Klein, 2012).” (Elert and Stenkula, 2020, p. 4)

> “Managing the tradeoff between productive and destructive proxyentrepreneurship becomes a critical management task, for which ownership plays a key role, since it “conveys the right to define key elements of this organizational structure” (Foss & Klein, 2012, p. 220, cf. Foss & Klein, 2015).” (Elert and Stenkula, 2020, p. 4)

> “Yet, we acknowledge that like all entrepreneurs, intrapreneurs operate under Knightian uncertainty and make judgments about the future state of the world (Foss & Klein, 2012; cf. McCaffrey, 2018). Hence, intrapreneurship is an innovative process that takes place under uncertainty (cf. Leyden & Link, 2015). This approach reveals that intrapreneurship is at least as multifaceted a phenomenon as entrepreneurship.” (Elert and Stenkula, 2020, p. 4)

> “Most intrapreneurship research assumes that the phenomenon is beneficial. In Baumol’s (1990) vein, we have argued that just like entrepreneurship, whether intrapreneurial activities are allocated to productive, unproductive, or destructive uses depends, largely, on the rules of the game that intrapreneurs face.” (Elert and Stenkula, 2020, p. 11)
