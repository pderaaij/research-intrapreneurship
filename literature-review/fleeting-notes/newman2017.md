## Abstract

Since the concept of psychological safety was introduced, empirical research on its antecedents, outcomes, and moderators at different levels of analysis has proliferated. Given a burgeoning body of empirical evidence, a systematic review of the psychological safety literature is warranted. As well as reviewing empirical work on psychological safety, the present article highlights gaps in the literature and provides direction for future work. In doing so, it highlights the need to advance our understanding of psychological safety through the integration of key theoretical perspectives to explain how psychological safety develops and inﬂluences work outcomes at different levels of analysis. Suggestions for future empirical research to advance our understanding of psychological safety are also provided.

## Notes

> “experimentation with new approaches in the workplace might ultimately be unsuccessful, viewed as a failure, and lead the individuals involved to be seen in a negative light (Van Dyne & LePine, 1998)” (Newman et al., 2017, p. 1)

> “The provision of a psychologically safe work environment (i.e., one in which employees feel safe to voice ideas, willingly seek feedback, provide honest feedback, collaborate, take risks and experiment, is one way to overcome such threats to individual and organizational learning; Edmondson, 1999)” (Newman et al., 2017, p. 1)

> “Psychologically safety is especially important in work environments where employee and customer safety are paramount, such as the healthcare or aviation industries, as it has been shown to be critical in reducing employee errors and enhancing safety (Leroy et al., 2012; Nembhard & Edmondson, 2011), and been shown to increase team and individual learning across multiple organizations (e.g., Liu, Hu, Li, Wang, & Lin, 2014; Ortega, Sanchez-Manzanares, Gil, & Rico, 2010).” (Newman et al., 2017, p. 1)

> “defining it as a shared belief amongst individuals as to whether it is safe to engage in interpersonal risk-taking in the workplace (Edmondson, Dillon, & Roloff, 2007; Edmondson & Lei, 2014)” (Newman et al., 2017, p. 2)

> “In a psychologically safe work environment, employees feel that their colleagues will not reject people for being themselves or saying what they think, respect each other's competence, are interested in each other as people, have positive intentions to one another, are able engage in constructive conflict or confrontation, and feel that it is safe to experiment and take risks (Edmondson, 1999).” (Newman et al., 2017, p. 2)

> “Although psychological safety shares some overlap with trust, psychological safety is conceptually different as it focuses on how group members perceive a group norm, whilst trust focuses on how one person views another.” (Newman et al., 2017, p. 2)

> “Currently, theoretical perspectives such as social learning, social exchange and social identity theories have predominantly been used by researchers to explain the processes by which psychological safety develops and influences outcomes. Our review calls upon researchers to utilize alternate theories such as the Conservation of Resources Theory (Hobfoll, 1989) to explain how the psychological safety engendered through access to resources in the work environment motivates employees to invest their resources at work to help others, and stimulate learning, growth and development.” (Newman et al., 2017, p. 2)

> “More recently, Edmondson (1999) argued that psychological safety is better treated as a team-level climate and defined it as the “shared belief held by members of a team that the team is safe for interpersonal risk taking” (p. 350).” (Newman et al., 2017, p. 3)

> “In general, however, we believe that psychological safety is likely to be more potent and meaningful at the team level, rather than the organizational level.” (Newman et al., 2017, p. 4)

> “A lack of correspondence between the conceptual definition of the construct and the operational procedure to measure it, often results in compromised construct validity (Schwab, 1980).” (Newman et al., 2017, p. 4)

> “Edmondson's (1999) measure of psychological safety has consistently been found to be reliable across diverse samples as evidenced by the fact that all of the studies that we reviewed, that used her 7-item measure, reported very good internal consistency reliability estimates.” (Newman et al., 2017, p. 4)

> “at the individual level empirical work has established that leader inclusiveness (Bienefeld & Grote, 2014; Carmeli et al., 2010), support (May et al., 2004), trustworthiness (Madjar & Ortiz-Walters, 2009), openness (Detert & Burris, 2007) and behavioral integrity (Palanski & Vogelgesang, 2011)stronglyinfluence employee perceptions of psychological safety, which in turn, drive employee outcomes including voice behaviors, involvement in creative work, job performance and engagement.” (Newman et al., 2017, p. 5)

> “at the team level employees' collective perceptions of support and coaching forwarded by the team leader (Edmondson, 1999; Roberto, 2002), leader inclusiveness (Hirak et al., 2012; Nembhard & Edmondson, 2006), trust in the leader (Li & Tan, 2012; Schaubroeck, Lam, & Peng, 2011), and the behavioral integrity of the leader (Leroy et al., 2012) have been found to foster team-level outcomes such as team learning behavior, team performance, engagement in quality improvement work, and reduction in errors amongst team members through the development of psychological safety.” (Newman et al., 2017, p. 5)

> “that positive leadership styles such as transformational leadership (Nemanich & Vera, 2009), ethical leadership (Walumbwa & Schaubroeck, 2009), change-oriented leadership (Ortega, Van den Bossche, Sanchez-Manzanares, Rico, & Gil, 2014) and shared leadership (Liu et al., 2014) are positively and strongly related to such outcomes as employee voice behavior, team learning, and individual learning through the mediating mechanism of psychological safety.” (Newman et al., 2017, p. 5)

> “Finally, research has established that leaders who value participation, people, and production use dyadic discovery methods rather than group-based discovery methods (Roussin, 2008; Wong, Tjosvold, & Lu, 2010), and an improvement orientation management style (Halbesleben & Rathert, 2008), are able to foster high levels of psychological safety.” (Newman et al., 2017, p. 5)

> “research has found that employee perceptions of organizational support (Carmeli & Zisu, 2009), access to mentoring (Chen et al., 2014), and diversity practices (Singh et al., 2013) foster work outcomes through the mediating mechanism of psychological safety.” (Newman et al., 2017, p. 5)

> “he team level, researchers have found that relationship networks, and the social support and resources inherent in such networks, promote psychological safety and contribute to team learning, performance, and innovation.” (Newman et al., 2017, p. 5)

> “researchers have found that the key drivers of psychological safety and its outcomes are: the level of prior interaction between; and familiarity among, team members (Roberto, 2002); the quality of social relationships between team members as measured by trust; network ties and collective thinking (Gu, Wang, & Wang, 2013; Huang & Jiang, 2012; Schulte, Cohen, & Klein, 2012); high quality relationships between team members and external parties (Brueller & Carmeli, 2011); and membership of the inner-circle (Burris, Rodgers, Mannix, Hendron, & Oldroyd, 2009).” (Newman et al., 2017, p. 5)

> “a small number of researchers have proposed that social relationships may engender psychological safety through social learning processes (e.g. Carmeli, 2007; Gu et al., 2013).” (Newman et al., 2017, p. 6)

> “at the individual level researchers have found that employee perceptions of similarity in systems understanding among team members (Bendoly, 2014), and a continuous quality improvement climate in teams (Rathert, Ishqaidef, & May, 2009), influence project performance and organizational commitment respectively through higher levels of psychological safety within the team.” (Newman et al., 2017, p. 6)

> “At the team level, researchers have found that characteristics such as shared team rewards (Chen & Tjosvold, 2012), formal team structures (Bresman & Zellmer-Bruhn, 2013; Bunderson & Boumgarden, 2010), and team engagement in boundary work (buffering, spanning, and reinforcement) (Faraj & Yan, 2009) are positively associated with higher levels of team psychological safety.” (Newman et al., 2017, p. 6)

> “Finally, O'Neill (2009) found that when team members were collectively responsible for bad investment decisions, psychological safety gave them the courage to admit failure, whereas when they were individually responsible, psychological safety escalated their commitment to bad investment decisions. They argued that this is due to the fact that, when there is collective responsibility, team members are less motivated to salvage a project that may fail.” (Newman et al., 2017, p. 6)

> “At the individual and team level, psychological safety has been linked to communication outcomes such as greater reporting of treatment errors and more interpersonal communication (Leroy et al., 2012; Peltokorpi, 2004), as well as greater knowledge sharing among team members (Mu & Gnyawali, 2003; Siemsen, Roth, Balasubramanian, & Anand, 2009; Xu & Yang, 2010; Zhang, Fang, Wei, & Chen, 2010).” (Newman et al., 2017, p. 6)

> “Psychological safety within dyadic relationships and teams has also been shown to lead to more voice behavior among employees (Bienefeld & Grote, 2014; Detert & Burris, 2007; Liang et al., 2012; Tynan, 2005), and a reduction in silence behaviors (Brinsfield, 2013)” (Newman et al., 2017, p. 6)

> “suggests that through signaling it is acceptable to take risks, experiment and voice their ideas and concerns to team members, a psychologically safe work environment will foster team and individual learning.” (Newman et al., 2017, p. 7)

> “In their meta-analysis, Sanner and Bunderson (2013) found the indirect effect of psychological safety on team performance, through team learning, to be 0.17 (95% CI = 0.14 to 0.20).” (Newman et al., 2017, p. 7)

> “Finally, at the organizational-level, Baer and Frese (2003) found that employees' collective perceptions of psychological safety were strongly and positively related to firm performance, as measured by return on assets and goal achievement.” (Newman et al., 2017, p. 7)

> “there is growing evidence of a link between employee perceptions of psychological safety within the organization and their creativity (Carmeli et al., 2010; Kark & Carmeli, 2009)” (Newman et al., 2017, p. 7)

> “Palanski and Vogelgesang (2011) also found evidence of a positive link between employee perceptions of team psychological safety and both creative thinking and risk-taking.” (Newman et al., 2017, p. 7)

> “At the team-level, research has found that team psychological safety is strongly and positively related to innovation in R&D teams (Gu et al., 2013; Post, 2012), manufacturing process innovation performance (Lee, Swink, & Pandejpong, 2011) and knowledge creation (Choo, Linderman, & Schroeder, 2007)” (Newman et al., 2017, p. 7)

> “Kessel, Kratzer, and Schultz (2012) found that team psychological safety was positively related to creative team performance and this relationship was mediated by the sharing of two types of knowledge: information and know-how.” (Newman et al., 2017, p. 7)

> “However, Kayes (2006) found no evidence that psychological safety led to higher levels of critical thinking within teams.” (Newman et al., 2017, p. 7)

> “At the individual level, a number of studies have established a strong and positive link between psychological safety and the work attitudes of employees such as organizational commitment (Chen et al., 2014; De Clercq & Rius, 2007; Rathert et al., 2009), work engagement (May et al., 2004; Nembhard & Edmondson, 2006) and positive attitudes towards teamwork (Ulloa & Adams, 2004).” (Newman et al., 2017, p. 7)

> “Finally, Edmondson et al. (2001) found that psychological safety positively influenced the successful implementation of new technology” (Newman et al., 2017, p. 7)

> “In their meta-analysis, Sanner and Bunderson (2013) found that psychological safety was more strongly related to team learning and performance in task environments that benefit from learning. For example, they found that association between psychological safety and team learning to be stronger in task environments where there were higher creativity requirements (β =0.39,p b 0.01), sense-making requirements (β =0.54,p b 0.01), complexity (β = 0.63, p b 0.01), and social contact/impact (β =0.50,p b 0.01).” (Newman et al., 2017, p. 7)

> “Moreover, Sanner and Bunderson (2013) found that the association between psychological safety and team performance was stronger in task environments where there were higher creativity requirements (β = 0.69, p b 0.01), sense-making requirements (β = 0.31, p b 0.01) and complexity (β = 0.73, p b 0.01).” (Newman et al., 2017, p. 7)

> “At an individual level, Tangirala, Kamdar, Venkataramani, and Parke (2013) found that when individuals perceived their environment to be psychological safe, this weakened the negative relationship between achievement orientation and role conceptualization.” (Newman et al., 2017, p. 8)

> “At the team level, Martins, Schilpzand, Kirkman, Ivanaj, and Ivanaj (2013) found that when psychological safety was low, expertise diversity had a stronger negative relationship with team performance. In contrast, when psychological safety was high, team expertise diversity had a stronger positive relationship with team performance.” (Newman et al., 2017, p. 8)

> “Pearsall and Ellis (2011) revealed that psychological safety moderated the relationship between utilitarianism and unethical outcomes, such that members of teams high in psychological safety were more likely to engage in unethical behaviors compared to those from teams that were low in psychological safety.” (Newman et al., 2017, p. 8)

> “At the organizational level, Baer and Frese (2003) established that at high levels of psychological safety, the relationship between process innovativeness (i.e., the use of advanced manufacturing techniques) and profitability (i.e., return on assets), was positive, whereas at low levels of organizational psychological safety, the relationship was negative.” (Newman et al., 2017, p. 8)

> “As can be seen in Fig. 1, although psychological safety is a multilevel construct, our review suggests that it is likely to be more potent and meaningful at the team level, as opposed to the organizational level, unless the organization is small.” (Newman et al., 2017, p. 8)

> “Our review also established that psychological safety is a valuable resource, especially important in hazardous work contexts where speaking up and providing feedback is imperative in order to reduce errors and improve safety.” (Newman et al., 2017, p. 8)

> “We call on researchers to conduct additional research to improve our understanding of how variables at different levels of analysis interact to predict psychological safety. Better understanding of how cultural, organizational, and team-level factors combine to predict the development of psychological safety will enable organizations to design effective work environments and practices that assist individuals and teams to work effectively.” (Newman et al., 2017, p. 12)
