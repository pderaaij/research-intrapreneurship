> “In turn, employees are expected to take a more active role at work, which has resulted in organizational scholars attempting to identify the factors that foster the willingness by employees to take interpersonal risks and invest their energies into work (Kahn, 1990).” (Frazier et al., 2017, p. 114)

> “This research has generally demonstrated that psychological safety allows employees “to feel safe at work in order to grow, learn, contribute, and perform effectively in a rapidly changing world” (Edmondson & Lei, 2014, p. 23)” (Frazier et al., 2017, p. 114)

> “As noted by Edmondson and Lei (2014), “a central theme in research on psychological safety—across decades and levels of analysisis that it facilitates the willing contribution of ideas and actions to a shared enterprise” (p. 24).” (Frazier et al., 2017, p. 116)

> “Psychological empowerment represents an intrinsic motivational state in which employees feel they have a sense of control over their work (Spreitzer, 1995).” (Frazier et al., 2017, p. 116)

> “Work engagement refers to a cognitive state in which individuals invest their personal resources and energies into their work roles and tasks (Christian, Garza, & Slaughter, 2011; Kahn, 1990).” (Frazier et al., 2017, p. 116)

> “Although psychological empowerment, work engagement, and psychological safety all represent positive motivational states toward one’s work, they are distinct in that psychological empowerment and work engagement refer to one’s cognitions about their specific jobs or tasks (Spreitzer, 1995). Psychological safety, on the other hand, refers to perceptions of the broader social and work environment, and how people perceive that others in the workplace will respond to risk-taking behaviors (Carmeli & Gittell, 2009). Thus, it represents perceptions one holds of the environment in which they work rather than about their specific jobs or tasks.” (Frazier et al., 2017, p. 116)

> “However, Edmondson (2004) differentiated the two constructs by highlighting the focus of each constructs. Specifically, trust captures one’s willingness to be vulnerable to others, thus demarcating one’s willingness to give the other person the benefit of the doubt. Psychological safety, on the other hand, captures the extent to which one believes that others will give them the benefit of the doubt when taking risks (Edmondson, 2004).” (Frazier et al., 2017, p. 117)

> “Kahn (1990) very broadly identified four antecedents to psychological safety: interpersonal relationships, group dynamics, leadership, and organizational norms.” (Frazier et al., 2017, p. 117)

> “Proactive individuals take it upon themselves to enact change, detect problems, and subsequently solve those problems (Crant, 2000; Seibert, Crant, & Kraimer, 1999).” (Frazier et al., 2017, p. 117)

> “Of the Big Five personality constructs, two have been theoretically linked to psychological safety: emotional stability and openness to experience. Emotionally stable individuals are more likely to perceive a psychologically safe environment because they tend to be calm, relaxed, and secure as opposed to anxious, hostile, and vulnerable to stress (Costa & McCrae, 1992; Judge, Bono, & Locke, 2000). Additionally, individuals that are open to new experiences tend to be curious and imaginative with a preference for novelty (Costa & McCrae, 1992).” (Frazier et al., 2017, p. 118)

> “Hypothesis 1: Psychological safety is positively related to (a) proactive personality, (b) emotional stability, (c) openness to experience, and (d) learning orientation.” (Frazier et al., 2017, p. 118)

> “Further, the social exchanges between leaders and followers have a crucial impact on the formalization of expectations regarding what is and is not appropriate behavior (Edmondson, 2004).” (Frazier et al., 2017, p. 118)

> “Hypothesis 2: Psychological safety is positively related to positive leader relations.” (Frazier et al., 2017, p. 119)

> “Hypothesis 3: Psychological safety is positively related to the work design characteristics of (a) autonomy, (b) interdependence, and (c) role clarity.” (Frazier et al., 2017, p. 119)

> “Hypothesis 4: Psychological safety is positively related to supportive work context.” (Frazier et al., 2017, p. 119)

> “Kahn’s (1990) work cast psychological safety as a condition necessary for work engagement, defined as “the harnessing of organization members’ selves to their work roles; in engagement, people employ and express themselves physically, cognitively, and emotionally during role performances” (p. 694).” (Frazier et al., 2017, p. 120)

> “Hypothesis 5: Psychological safety is positively related to work engagement.” (Frazier et al., 2017, p. 120)

> “Hypothesis 6: Psychological safety is positively related to task performance.” (Frazier et al., 2017, p. 121)

> “Hypothesis 7: Psychological safety is positively related to (a) information sharing, (b) citizenship behaviors, (c) creativity, and (d) learning behavior.” (Frazier et al., 2017, p. 122)

> “Hypothesis 8: Psychological safety is positively related to (a) commitment and (b) satisfaction.” (Frazier et al., 2017, p. 122)

> “Research Question 1: Does psychological safety explain variance in task performance and citizenship behaviors over and beyond its nomological network variables?” (Frazier et al., 2017, p. 123)

> “Research Question 2: Do research design characteristics influence effect sizes in the nomological network of psychological safety?” (Frazier et al., 2017, p. 123)

> “However, Edmondson and Lei (2014) call for research in this area and note that “employees in certain cultures may be particularly hesitant to ask questions, provide feedback, or openly disagree with their superiors” (p. 8), all behaviors that are theoretically affiliated with psychological safety.” (Frazier et al., 2017, p. 124)

> “Research Question 3: Does UA influence effect sizes in the nomological network of psychological safety?” (Frazier et al., 2017, p. 124)

> “Research Question 4: Does psychological safety demonstrate homology across levels?” (Frazier et al., 2017, p. 125)

> “Hypothesis 1 was partially supported as we found that three of the four personality variables were related to psychological safety. Proactive personality ( ˆ ρ = .35), emotional stability ( ˆ ρ = .17), and learning orientation ( ˆ ρ = .24) were positive and significantly related. Contrary to expectations, openness to experience was not significantly related to psychological safety.” (Frazier et al., 2017, p. 129)

> “Hypothesis 2 was supported as psychological safety and positive leader relations were” (Frazier et al., 2017, p. 129)

> “Hypotheses 3 and 4 were also supported, as the relationships between psychological safety and autonomy ( ˆ ρ = .47), interdependence (ˆ ρ = .86), role clarity ( ˆ ρ = .63), and supportive work context ( ˆ ρ = .49) were all significant and positive.” (Frazier et al., 2017, p. 130)

> “Hypothesis 5 was supported as psychological safety was positively and significantly related to work engagement ( ˆ ρ = .45). Hypothesis 6 indicated that psychological safety would be positively related to task performance and this was supported by our results ( ˆ ρ = .43). Hypothesis 7 was supported as the mean corrected correlations were significant for” (Frazier et al., 2017, p. 130)

> “Finally, Hypothesis 8 received support as the mean corrected correlations between psychological safety and both commitment ( ˆ ρ = .48) and satisfaction (ˆ ρ = .53) were significant and in the expected direction.” (Frazier et al., 2017, p. 131)

> “With regard to personality variables at the group level, only learning orientation had enough of a sample size and it was positively related to psychological safety ( ˆ ρ = .40), providing support for Hypothesis 1d.” (Frazier et al., 2017, p. 131)

> “Similar to the individual level, we found that positive leader relations (ˆ ρ = .39), autonomy ( ˆ ρ = .35), interdependence ( ˆ ρ = .40), role clarity (ˆ ρ = .51), and supportive work context ( ˆ ρ = .51) were all positively and significantly related to psychological safety, supporting Hypotheses 2–4.” (Frazier et al., 2017, p. 131)

> “Hypothesis 5 was again supported as psychological safety was significantly and positively related to work engagement ( ˆ ρ = .44). Hypothesis 6 was supported at the group level as psychological safety was positively related to task performance ( ˆ ρ = .29). We did not have enough primary studies to examine citizenship behaviors, but we found that information sharing ( ˆ ρ = .50), creativity ( ˆ ρ = .29), and learning behavior ( ˆ ρ = .52) were significantly related to psychological safety, supporting Hypotheses 7a, 7c, and 7d.” (Frazier et al., 2017, p. 132)

> “We were not able to examine the relationship with commitment at the group level but did find that satisfaction ( ˆ ρ = .69) was significantly related to psychological safety, providing support for Hypothesis 8b.” (Frazier et al., 2017, p. 132)

> “In sum, these results show that psychological safety does explain unique variance in both outcomes over and beyond each of the nomological network variables, providing an affirmative response to Research Question 1.” (Frazier et al., 2017, p. 132)

> “Our review of the literature and empirical analysis at the individual level resulted in support for the majority of the hypothesized relationships. Contrary to our expectations, however, openness to experience was not significantly related to psychological safety. Those high in openness to experience are described as being independent thinkers, amenable to new ideas, and more likely to challenge the status quo (Zhou & George, 2001). It may be that those high in openness to experience are more focused on ways to express their independence regardless of context and thus less likely to be concerned with psychological safety.” (Frazier et al., 2017, p. 140)

> “We found support for the relationship between psychological safety and positive leader relations as a general category. This highlights the salience of the direct leader in shaping the work context and crucial role leaders play in fostering psychological safety.” (Frazier et al., 2017, p. 140)

> “There is little variation in the extent to which each of these leadership constructs impacts psychological safety, an issue to which we return in the future directions section.” (Frazier et al., 2017, p. 140)

> “we also found that work design characteristics and supportive work context as broad categories both positively influence psychological safety. Within the category of work design characteristics, interdependence showed the strongest relationship. Peer support, within the category of supportive work context, also demonstrated a significant and strong effect.” (Frazier et al., 2017, p. 140)

> “We found that psychological safety was positively related to employee engagement, task performance, satisfaction, and commitment. We found a moderate relationship with citizenship behavior and a relatively weak one with creativity.” (Frazier et al., 2017, p. 140)

> “Given the rapid changes that businesses face in the modern economy and the seminal work from Edmondson (1999) on psychological safety and learning, one of the most relevant findings of our study is the strong relationship that psychological safety demonstrated wit” (Frazier et al., 2017, p. 140)

> “information sharing and learning behavior.” (Frazier et al., 2017, p. 141)

> “Indeed, the impact that psychological safety has on the learning process is “at the very core of why the construct has maintained the high level of research attention over the years” (Edmondson & Lei, 2014; p. 37) and why it likely will continue to be an important construct in the 21st century organization.” (Frazier et al., 2017, p. 141)

> “Interestingly, psychological safety accounted for more incremental variance explained in task performance than citizenship behaviors; the unique attitudes, cognitions, and behaviors that derive from a psychologically safe workforce seem to be more strongly related to in-role performance than extra-role behaviors.” (Frazier et al., 2017, p. 141)

> “With regard to antecedents, we found that positive personality traits, work design characteristics, and supportive work context all had significantly stronger effects on psychological safety in high UA cultures. Somewhat surprisingly, the effects of positive leadership relations were weaker in high UA cultures. Recall that high UA cultures value stability and the establishment of formal rules (Hofstede, 2001), and thus, it may require that the signals come from a broader range of sources in order to feel higher psychological safety in these cultures.” (Frazier et al., 2017, p. 144)

> “All in all, our results provide initial evidence that the role of psychological safety may be impacted by culture and encourage future research to more fully explore this issue.” (Frazier et al., 2017, p. 144)

> “Another critical question left unaddressed thus far in the psychological safety literature is, “can psychological safety lead to negative consequences?”” (Frazier et al., 2017, p. 145)

> “One exception, Liang et al. (2012) reported that psychological safety perceptions collected just 6 weeks apart were only moderately correlated (r = .27), which indicates that psychological safety may fluctuate over time within individuals.” (Frazier et al., 2017, p. 146)

> “As for the role of leadership, the results of our study across both levels of analysis clearly indicate that as leaders develop positive relationships with followers, higher perceptions of psychological safety are likely to occur.” (Frazier et al., 2017, p. 147)

> “However, other conceptual work has indicated a possible reciprocal relationship between psychological safety and engagement with both having the ability to influence the other positively (i.e., Saks, 2006).” (Frazier et al., 2017, p. 148)

> “A recent survey of employees across the world revealed that only 47% characterized their workplace as “a psychologically safe and healthy environment to work in” (Ipsos, 2012).” (Frazier et al., 2017, p. 149)
