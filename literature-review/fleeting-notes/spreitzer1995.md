# Extracted Annotations (2022-03-15)

> "Widespread interest in psychological empowerment conies at a time when global competition and change require employee initiative and innovation (Drucker. 1988)" ([Spreitzer 1995:25](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/N2CDRN4G?page=1))

> "Similarly, Conger and Kanungo (1988) argued that management practices are only one set of conditions and that those practices may empower employees but will not necessarily do so." ([Spreitzer 1995:26](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/N2CDRN4G?page=2))

> "Thomas and Velthouse (1990) argued that empowerment is multifaceted and that its essence cannot be captured by a single concept. Tbey defined empowerment more broadly as increased intrinsic task motivation manifested in a set of four cognitions reflecting an individual's orientation to his or her work role: meaning, competence (which is synonymous with Conger and Kanungo's self-efficacy), self-determination, and impact." ([Spreitzer 1995:26](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/N2CDRN4G?page=2))

> "Meaning. Meaning is the value of a work goal or purpose, judged in relation to an individual's own ideals or standards (Thomas & Velthouse, 1990). Meaning involves a fit between the requirements of a work role and beliefs, values, and behaviors (Brief & Nord, 1990; Hackman & Oldham, 1980)." ([Spreitzer 1995:26](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/N2CDRN4G?page=2))

An individuals own acceptance of the work goal or purpose in contrast with its own ideals or standards

> "Competence. Competence, or self-efficacy, is an individual's belief in his or her capability to perform activities witb skill (Gist, 1987). Competence is analogous to agency beliefs, personal mastery, or effort-performance expectancy (Bandura, 1989). Tbis dimension is labeled competence here ratber than self-esteem because I focused on efficacy specific to a work role ratber than on global efficacy" ([Spreitzer 1995:26](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/N2CDRN4G?page=2))

The belief to do something because you are able to

> "Self-determination. Where competence is a mastery of bebavior, selfdetermination is an individual's sense of having choice in initiating and regulating actions (Deci, Connell, & Ryan, 1989). Self-determination reflects autonomy in the initiation and continuation of work behaviors and processes; examples are making decisions about work methods, pace, and effort (Bell & Staw. 1989; Spector, 1986)" ([Spreitzer 1995:26](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/N2CDRN4G?page=2))

Being able to decide - on your own - if, when and how the work is going to be done or continued

> "Impact. Impact is the degree to which an individual can influence" ([Spreitzer 1995:26](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/N2CDRN4G?page=2))

> "Strategic, administrative, or operating outcomes at work (Ashforth. 1989). Impact is the converse of learned helplessness (Martinko & Gardner, 1982)" ([Spreitzer 1995:27](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/N2CDRN4G?page=3))

The amount of influence I cat have on processes or outcomes

> "In sum, psychological empowerment is defined as a motivational construct manifested in four cognitions; tneaning, competence, self-determination, and impact. Together, these four cognitions reflect an active, rather than a passive, orientation to a work role." ([Spreitzer 1995:27](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/N2CDRN4G?page=3))

> "By active orientation, I mean an orientation in which an individual wishes and feels able to shape his or her work role and context." ([Spreitzer 1995:27](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/N2CDRN4G?page=3))

> "First, empowerment is not an enduring personality trait generalizable across situations, but rather, a set of cognitions shaped by a work environment" ([Spreitzer 1995:27](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/N2CDRN4G?page=3))

It is important to note that these traits are connected to the environment a person is in. As such it is not a true or false statement, but more somewhere on a scale. The environment can ensure you are higher on the scale of empowerment

> "Two personality traits, self-esteem and locus of control, are hypothesized to be antecedents of empowerment hecause they shape how individuals see themselves in relation to their work environments." ([Spreitzer 1995:29](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/N2CDRN4G?page=5))

> "Individuals wbo hold themselves in high esteem are likely to extend their feelings of selfworth to a work-specific sense of competence (Bandura. 1977). Through self-esteem, individuals see themselves as valued resources having talents worth contributing, and they are thus more likely to assume an active orientation with regard to their work and work units" ([Spreitzer 1995:29](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/N2CDRN4G?page=5))

If an individual has a better perception of him or herself that would lead to perceiving themselves as more valuable and as such are likely to be more active in their work orientation

> "Locus of control explains the degree to which people believe that they, rather than external forces, determine what happens in their lives (Rotter, 1966)" ([Spreitzer 1995:29](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/N2CDRN4G?page=5))

> "Information. Kanter suggested that in order to be empowering, organizations must "make more information more available to more people at more levels through more devices" (19B9: 5" ([Spreitzer 1995:30](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/N2CDRN4G?page=6))

> "Lawler (.1992) suggested that two specific types of information are critical for empowerment: (1) information about an organization's mission and (2) information about performance." ([Spreitzer 1995:30](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/N2CDRN4G?page=6))

> "Information about mission is an important antecedent of empowerment because (1) it helps to create a sense of meaning and purpose (Conger & Kanungo, 1988) and (2) it enhances an individual's ability to make and influence decisions that are appropriately aligned with tbe organization's goals and mission (Lawler, 1992)." ([Spreitzer 1995:30](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/N2CDRN4G?page=6))

> "To be empowering, a reward system must recognize individual contribution (Lawler, 1986)." ([Spreitzer 1995:31](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/N2CDRN4G?page=7))

> "Though rewards for group or organization performance may be heneficial, often individuals do not have a clear understanding of how their own actions can influence performance at higher levels (Lawler. 1986)." ([Spreitzer 1995:31](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/N2CDRN4G?page=7))

> "Managerial effectiveness is generally defined as the degree to which a manager fulfills or exceeds work role expectations." ([Spreitzer 1995:31](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/N2CDRN4G?page=7))

> "Innovative behaviors reflect the creation of something new or different. Innovative bebaviors are by definition change-oriented because they involve the creation of a new product, service, idea, procedure, or process (Woodman, Sawyer, & Criffin, 1993)" ([Spreitzer 1995:32](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/N2CDRN4G?page=8))

> "More specifically, hecause empowered individuals believe they are autonomous and have an impact, tbey are likely to be creative; they feel less constrained than others by technical or rule-bound aspects of work (Amabile, 1988)." ([Spreitzer 1995:32](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/N2CDRN4G?page=8))
