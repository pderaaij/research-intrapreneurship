## Abstract

The intrapreneurial behavior of employees has become of strategic importance for the performance of organizations. However, the literature on intrapreneurship is dispersed and in need of an integrated overview of the characteristics and behaviors of intrapreneurial employees. Based on a systematic literature review, we propose a new definition of intrapreneurship that emphasizes its multilevel nature. Moreover, we propose a comprehensive model of intrapreneurship in which we integrate the new definition, dimensions, and determinants applicable to individual employees. We find that innovativeness, proactiveness, risk-taking, opportunity recognition / exploitation and internal / external networking are important behavioral dimensions of intrapreneurship. A certain skillset, a perception of their own capabilities, personal knowledge, past experience, the relation with the organization, motivation, satisfaction and intention are the determinants of intrapreneurial behavior that we derived from the literature review. Based on our results and an integrated model of intrapreneurship, we suggest a number of future research directions.

> “We find that innovativeness, proactiveness, risk-taking, opportunity recognition / exploitation and internal / external networking are important behavioral dimensions of intrapreneurship.” (Neessen et al., 2019, p. 1)

> “Decision-making processes have become more decentralized and employees are gaining more discretion and responsibility (Foss et al. 2015).” (Neessen et al., 2019, p. 2)

> “Rather than being passive recipients of changing jobs and products, employees need to adopt roles as “innovators” and “differentiators” (Bowen 2016).” (Neessen et al., 2019, p. 2)

> “More specifically, employees are increasingly required to adopt a more intrapreneurial way of working to deal with or even initiate these changing requirements and directly impact a firm’s strategic direction (Hart 1992; Peters and Waterman 1982).” (Neessen et al., 2019, p. 2)

> “For instance, employees with intrapreneurial experience are more likely to show intrapreneurial behavior (Urbano et al. 2013).” (Neessen et al., 2019, p. 3)

> “From this analysis we concluded that the terms ‘intrapreneurship’ and ‘corporate entrepreneurship’ are the main ones used in the literature.” (Neessen et al., 2019, p. 5)

> “Intrapreneurship is a process whereby employee(s) recognize and exploit opportunities by being innovative, proactive and by taking risks, in order for the organization to create new products, processes and services, initiate selfrenewal or venture new businesses to enhance the competitiveness and performance of the organization.” (Neessen et al., 2019, p. 7)

> “These themes could be divided into two groups. It could be argued that the first three themes (new product/innovation, new business venturing and self-renewal) are goals of intrapreneurship, while the remaining three (opportunity recognition and exploitation, proactiveness and risk-taking) are characteristics of intrapreneurship. In this definition, intrapreneurship is therefore operationalized as a process, in line with Berzin et al. (2016), Fischer (2011), Garcia-Morales et al. (2014)and Halme et al.(2012). The rationale behind this is that intrapreneurship is not merely a behavior of an individual or an organization, but is about a set of activities of an individual or an organization to get from point A to point B in time, with an increased competitiveness and performance of the organization as the end goal.” (Neessen et al., 2019, p. 8)

> “Articles that investigated the behavior of the intrapreneur mostly concentrated on these dimensions: innovativeness/creativeness, proactiveness, opportunity recognition and exploitation, risk-taking and networking.” (Neessen et al., 2019, p. 8)

> “Research indicates that perceptions of innovativeness, proactiveness and risk-taking of the organization have a positive relation with organizational commitment (Giannikis and Nikandrou 2013; Rutherford and Holt 2007).” (Neessen et al., 2019, p. 11)

> “We found a number of characteristics that describe the intrapreneurial employee. One of them is the perception that employees have about themselves. This perception is often referred to as self-efficacy, which is an individuals’ belief that he or she is capable of successfully performing a certain task (Wang et al. 2013).” (Neessen et al., 2019, p. 12)

> “A relation is found between selfefficacy and intrapreneurship. Entrepreneurial behavior, opportunity recognition, and product performance are higher when the employee has more self-efficacy (Rutherford and Holt 2007; Simon et al. 2002;Urbanoetal.2013; Wakkee et al. 2010;Zampetakis et al. 2009). Higher self-efficacy also leads to a higher intention to act entrepreneurially (Douglas and Fitzsimmons 2013;Hanson2017), which is one of the attitudes of the intrapreneur found in this systematic literature review.” (Neessen et al., 2019, p. 12) Interesting to research if there is an relation between psychological safety and self-efficiacy

> “Receiving management support is very important to the employees willing to undertake intrapreneurial activities. Management support refers to the willingness of management to facilitate and promote intrapreneurship (Marvel et al. 2007; Sebora et al. 2010), including encouraging employees and recognizing that their activities involve some risk-taking (Kelley and Lee 2010; Kuratko et al. 1990), and creating a norm within the organization (Garcia-Morales et al. 2014).” (Neessen et al., 2019, p. 15)

> “Puech and Durand (2017) researched what how long intrapreneurs needed to become intrapreneurs. They found that the quality of time is more important than the actual amount of time, especially during the exploration phase in which it is not always clear what activities the intrapreneur should undertake.” (Neessen et al., 2019, p. 16)

> “We define intrapreneurship as a bottom-up process whereby employee(s) recognize and exploit opportunities by being innovative, proactive and by taking risks, in order for the organization to create new products, processes and services, initiate self-renewal or venture new businesses to enhance the competitiveness and performance of the organization.” (Neessen et al., 2019, p. 16)

> “we know that intrapreneurship is often related to innovativeness, proactiveness and risk-taking of the organization itself. In other words, the organization behaves as an intrapreneurial organization. For an organization to behave like this, employees should also exhibit these behaviors. Thus, we conclude that when individual employees are intrapreneurial, this leads to intrapreneurial outcomes at the organizational level, such as self-renewal and new products.” (Neessen et al., 2019, p. 16)
