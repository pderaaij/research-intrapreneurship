> “Theories of person-environment (PE) interaction have been prevalent in the management literature for almost 100 years (e.g., Ekehammer, 1974; Lewin, 1935; Murray, 1938; Parsons, 1909; Pervin, 1968), making it “one of the more venerable lines of psychological theorizing” (Dawis, 1992).” (Kristof-Brown et al., 2005, p. 281)

> “PE fit is broadly defined as the compatibility between an individual and a work environment that occurs when their characteristics are well matched.” (Kristof-Brown et al., 2005, p. 281)

> “Furthermore, his review did not distinguish between fit with the job, group, organization, or vocation, which have been shown to have unique relationships with attitudes and behaviors (Cable & DeRue, 2002).” (Kristof-Brown et al., 2005, p. 282)

> “Accordingly, the purpose of this study is to empirically summarize the existing literature in four critical domains of PE fit: person–job, personorganization, person–group, and person–supervisor fit.” (Kristof-Brown et al., 2005, p. 283)

> “PE fit research is generally characterized by matching individuals to various levels of their work environment (Judge & Ferris, 1992; Kristof, 1996). The broadest of these levels is the vocation or occupation. This research on person–vocation (P–V) fit includes vocational choice theories that propose matching people with careers that meet their interests (e.g., Holland, 1985; Parsons, 1909; Super, 1953), and the theory of work adjustment (Dawis & Lofquist, 1984; Lofquist & Dawis, 1969), which emphasizes that adjustment and satisfaction are the result of employees’ needs being met by their occupational environment.” (Kristof-Brown et al., 2005, p. 284)

> “Instead, we emphasize an area closely related to PV fit but defined more narrowly as the relationship between a person’s characteristics and those of the job or tasks that are performed at work. This is the domain of personjob (PJ) fit (e.g., Edwards, 1991; Kristof, 1996).” (Kristof-Brown et al., 2005, p. 284)

> “The first is the demands-abilities fit, in which employees’ knowledge, skills, and abilities are commensurate with what the job requires. The second form of PJ fit occurs when” (Kristof-Brown et al., 2005, p. 284)

> “employees’ needs, desires, or preferences are met by the jobs that they perform. This type of fit, often labeled needs–supplies or supplies–values fit, has been the emphasis of various theories of adjustment, well-being, and satisfaction (Caplan, 1983; French, Caplan, & Harrison, 1974; Harrison, 1978; Locke, 1969; Porter, 1961, 1962).” (Kristof-Brown et al., 2005, p. 285)

> “Research on person–organization (PO) fit, which addresses the compatibility between people and entire organizations, is the second type of fit we review. Beginning with Tom’s (1971) suggestion that individuals will be most successful in organizations that share their personalities, research has emphasized individual–organizational similarity as the crux of PO fit.” (Kristof-Brown et al., 2005, p. 285)

> “The third category of research we review is person–group (PG) or person–team fit, which focuses on the interpersonal compatibility between individuals and their work groups (Judge & Ferris, 1992; Kristof, 1996; Werbel & Gilliland, 1999).” (Kristof-Brown et al., 2005, p. 286)

> “These aggregate-level studies predict unit-level outcomes, rather than individual-level criteria that we emphasize. Studies by Ostroff and Rothhausen (1997) and Vancouver, Millsap, and Peters (1994) demonstrate that fit–outcome relationships differ when they are assessed at higher levels of analysis, underscoring the need to differentiate aggregate-level fit studies from others.” (Kristof-Brown et al., 2005, p. 286)

> “A final form of PE fit exists in the dyadic relationships between individuals and others in their work environments. Although dyadic fit may occur between coworkers (e.g., Antonioni & Park, 2001), applicants and recruiters (e.g., Graves & Powell, 1995), and mentors and prot ́ eg ́ es (e.g., Turban & Dougherty, 1994), by far the most well-researched area is the match between supervisors and subordinates (e.g., Adkins, Russel, & Werbel, 1994; Van Vianen, 2000).” (Kristof-Brown et al., 2005, p. 287)

> “In response to this ambiguity, they proposed two distinct conceptualizations of PE fit: complementary and supplementary fit. For complementary fit, “the basis for a good fit is the mutually offsetting pattern of relevant characteristics between the person and the environment” (Muchinsky & Monahan, 1987, pp. 272). Although they operationalized this type of fit strictly as individuals’ skills meeting environmental needs (demands–abilities fit), Kristof (1996) expanded the definition to include when individuals’ needs are met by environmental supplies (needs–supplies fit). Thus, complementary fit occurs when individuals’ characteristics fill a gap in the current environment, or vice versa.” (Kristof-Brown et al., 2005, p. 288)

> “The second major conceptualization of fit, supplementary fit, exists when the individual and the environment are similar. Whereas complementary conceptualizations of fit have dominated the PJ fit literature, supplementary fit has been the focus of other types of fit.” (Kristof-Brown et al., 2005, p. 288)

> “Similarly, a needs–supplies fit, which has traditionally emphasized individuals’ needs and preferences, can also be considered to include value preferences, or what types of values a person wants in an organization. For example, the wording of the original Organizational Culture Profile (OCP; O’Reilly, Chatman, & Caldwell, 1991) requests that respondents indicate what values they prefer or want in an organization, rather than what their personal values actually are.” (Kristof-Brown et al., 2005, p. 289)

> “Thus, we use the terms as follows: (a) perceived fit, when an individual makes a direct assessment of the compatibility between P and E; (b) subjective fit, when fit is assessed indirectly through the comparison of P and E variables reported by the same person; and (c) objective fit, when fit is calculated indirectly through the comparison of P and E variables as reported by different sources.” (Kristof-Brown et al., 2005, p. 291)

> “It would produce cognitive dissonance for an individual to appraise a work environment as providing a poor fit but still report a high level of satisfaction with that environment. Therefore, it is likely that perceived, subjective, and objective fit differ not only in how they are measured but also in what they represent conceptually.” (Kristof-Brown et al., 2005, p. 291)

> “Perceived fit allows the greatest level of cognitive manipulation because the assessment is all done in the head of the respondents, allowing them to apply their own weighting scheme to various aspects of the environment.” (Kristof-Brown et al., 2005, p. 291)

> “Alternatively, indirect measures require separate ratings across specific P and E dimensions, and each dimension is weighted equally. Indirect measures of subjective fit still have P and E variables assessed by the same source, which does not fully negate consistency biases. Because both perceived and subjective fit are assessed by a single source, we expect that they will have similar effects on outcomes, particularly attitudes, with perceived fit having slightly stronger effects because it allows a single individual to report a holistic assessment of fit and is more prone to consistency effects.” (Kristof-Brown et al., 2005, p. 292)

> “group effects theory (e.g., Blau, 1960; Merton & Kitt, 1950) and theories of organizational culture (e.g., Levinthal & March, 1993; Schein, 1992) suggest that higherlevel units are more than the aggregate of attributes of their members.” (Kristof-Brown et al., 2005, p. 292)

> “One approach to reducing the impact of common rater bias, which is primarily a concern in fit–attitude studies, is to temporally separate the measurement of the predictor and criterion. Because a time delay should reduce consistency and illusory correlations between constructs (Podsakoff et al., 2003), we expect larger effect sizes between fit and attitudes measured concurrently versus at different points in time.” (Kristof-Brown et al., 2005, p. 293)

> “Because of their emphasis on the people in the environment, and on need–supplies and supplementary fit conceptualizations, we expect that PO, PG, and PS fit will be more strongly related to each other than to PJ fit. This should particularly be true for cases of PJ fit that reflect a demands–abilities perspective, rather than a needs–supplies perspective.” (Kristof-Brown et al., 2005, p. 294)

> “PJ fit has strong correlations with the three primary attitudes studied in the fit literature: .56 with job satisfaction, .47 with organizational commitment, and −.46 with intent to quit.” (Kristof-Brown et al., 2005, p. 299)

> “It has a modest correlation with overall performance (.20) and is correlated somewhat more strongly (−.28) with indicators of strain.” (Kristof-Brown et al., 2005, p. 306)

> ““Of all the issues in psychology that have fascinated scholars and practitioners alike, none has been more pervasive than the one concerning the fit of person and environment” (Schneider, 2001, p. 141).” (Kristof-Brown et al., 2005, p. 315)

> “It is clear from these results that fit matters. Even during relatively brief preentry encounters, attitudes and decisions are strongly influenced by various types of fit. As anticipated, attitudes about various aspects of the environment were most strongly related to the corresponding type of fit. Job satisfaction was most strongly influenced by PJ fit, organizational commitment by PO fit, satisfaction with coworkers by PG fit, and satisfaction with supervisor with PS fit. These results provides additional support for the capability of individuals to, at least partially, compartmentalize their reactions to various aspects of their work environment.” (Kristof-Brown et al., 2005, p. 316)

> “In almost every case the complementary form of needs–supplies fit has the greatest impact on “individual attitudes and behavior” (Kristof-Brown et al., 2005, pp. 317 - 318)
