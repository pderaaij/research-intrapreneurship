## Key ideas

### Intrapreneurship and corporate entrepreneurship are synonomous

....

### Intrapreneurship is a process

“Intrapreneurship is a process whereby employee(s) recognize and exploit opportunities by being innovative, proactive and by taking risks, in order for the organization to create new products, processes and services, initiate selfrenewal or venture new businesses to enhance the competitiveness and performance of the organization.” (Neessen et al., 2019, p. 7).

Intrapreneurship is note merely a behaviour of an individual or an organisation. It is about a set of activities of an individual or organisation to get from point A to point B int time, with an increased compettiveness and performance of the organisation ad the end goal.

### Goals of intrapreneurship

It could be argued that _new product/innovation_, _new business venturing_, and _self-renewal_ are goals of intrapreneurship.

### Characteristics of intrapreneurship

_Opportunity recognition and exploitation_, _proactiveness_ , and _risk taking_ are characteristics of intrapreneurship.

### Higher self-efficiacy leads to a higher intention to act entrpreneurially

Self-efficiacy is the belief of an employee that he or she is capable of successfully performing a certain task. If this belief is a high for an indivdidual entrepreneurial behaviour, opportunity recognition, and product performance are higher. Additionallly it higher self-efficiacy leads to a higher intention to act entrepreneurially, being one of the attitudes of the intrapreneur.

### Management support is very important for willing employees

In order to undertake intrapreneurial activities for willing employees management support is very important. Management support here refers to the willingness of management to facilitate and promote intrapreneurship, including encouraging employees, and recoginising that their activities involve some risk taking, and creating the a norm within the organisation.

### Individuals need to be intrapreneurial in order for an organisation to behave intrapreneurially

Intrapreneurship is often releated to the innovativeness, proactiveness and risk-taking of the organisation it self. For an organisation to behave intrapreneurial it is essential that the employees exhibit these behaviours as well, to lead to intrapreneurial outcomes.
