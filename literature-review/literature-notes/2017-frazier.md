## Summary

The authors aggregated theoretical and empirical work to answer outstanding questions concerning psychological safety. It not only provides a [[nomological network]] of psychological safety, but also extends it in four different ways.

## Key ideas

### Psychological safety relates to perceptions of the work environment

Next to psychological safety the constructs of psychological empowerment and work engagement studied. [[empowerment|Psychological empowerment]] represents an intrinsic motivational state in which employees feel they have a sense of control over their work. Work engagement refers to a cognitive state in which individuals invest their personal resources and energies into their work roles and tasks. Trust is defined as the willingness to be vulnerable to the actions of others.

Psychological safety, psychological empowerment and work engagement all represent positive motivational states toward one's work. However both psychological empowerment and work engagement refer to one's cognitions about their specific jobs. In other works, how does one perceive their job. Psychological safety refers to the broader perspective of the social and work environment. Noting how people perceive that others in the workplace will respond to risk-taking behaviour. In other words, it regards the perception one holds of the environment in which they work, rather then their specific jobs or tasks.

### Psychological safety is distinct from trust

Trust captures elements of vulnerability and risk one perceives in the workplace, just like psychological safety. Edmondson (2004) displays the difference between the two constructs, by highlighting their focus. Trust captures one's willingness to be vulnerable to others. Psychological safety captures the extent of an individuals belief that others will give that individual the benefit of the doubt when taking risks.

### Proactive personality, emotional stability, and learning orientation are positively related to psychological safety at individual level

### At group level learning orientation is positively related to psychological safety

### Autonomy, interdependence, role clarity, and supportive work context are all positively related to psychological safety at individual level

### Work engagement is significantly related to psychological safety at individual level

### Developing positive relations between leaders and followers lead to higher perceptions of psychological safety

As for the role of leadership, the results of our study across both levels of analysis clearly indicate that as leaders develop positive relationships with followers, higher perceptions of psychological safety are likely to occur.
