## Summary

This research investigates whether job autonomy and job variety influence the entrepreneurial behaviour of employees. Both are job design variables that strongly influence employees' general work satisfaction and performance. Entrepreneurial behaviours are determined by the factors innovation, proactivity and risk taking. The researchers found that job autonmy makes a difference towards entrepreneurial behaviour in organizations. However, when taking innovation, proactivity and risk taking seperately a diverse impact was found.

## Key Ideas

### Innovation, proactivity and risk taking as features of entrepreneurial behaviour

Innovation, practivity and risk taking have been identified as features of entrepreneurial behaviour. These features appeared to be a higher-order construct. This construct was related, but not identical to individuals' job performance.

### Job autonomy is related with overall entrepreneurial behaviour, innovation & proactivity

This research follows Parker's (1998) definition of Job Autonomy:

> “Job autonomy enhances workers’ situational control beliefs: enabling them to determine independently how to do their job or tasks, which is associated with increased mastery experiences and more self-efficacy at work.

Taking into account this definition the authors found that job autonomy was related with overall entrepreneurial behaviour, and it's innovation and proactivity dimensions.

### Job variety relates with overall entrepreneurial behaviour, but not innovation, proactivity and risk taking

Although job variety relates with the overall entrepreneurial behaviour, it does not remain significant when testing for the dimensions of innovation, proactivity and risk taking.

This might be because job variety only influences the perceived capabilities for entrepreneurial behavior. Job autonomy on the other hand increasess the perceived control over the work environment wich also enhances employee' motivation or willingness to engage in such behaviour.
