## Summary

The authors performed an extensive meta-analysis on relationships between person-job, person-organisation, person-group, and person-supervisor fit. By examining a large set of published articles and other forms of research the authors not only summarised the existing research at that time, but also performed a quantitive analysis on the relationships between the various forms of fits.

## Key Ideas

### Person-Environment interaction is a wildly researched theory

For more then 100 years theories of person-environment interaction has been found in management literature. Making it “one of the more venerable lines of psychological theorising” (Dawis, 1992).” (Kristof-Brown et al., 2005, p. 281)

### PE Fit is the compatibility between individual and work environment

Broadly defined PE fit is the compatibility between an individual and a work environment that occurs when their characteristics are well matched [@kristof2005, p. 281].

PE fit research is generally about matching individuals to various levels of their work environment. Levels like person-job fit, person-organisation fit, or person-group fit.

| Tyoe of fit             | Focal view                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Person-job fit          | The relation between a person's characteristics and those of the job or task that are performed at work                                                                                                                                 |
| Person-organisation fit | The compatibility between people and entire organisations                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Person-group fit        | The interpersonal compatibility between individuals and their work groups                                                                                                                                                               |
| Person-supervisor fit   | Examines the dyadic relationship between individuals and others in their work environments. The relationship between supervisor and subordinate has been wildly researched, but could also be about a dyadic relationship between peers |

### Person-job fit can be either about demands-abilities or needs-supplies

Two different conceptualisations of person-job fit exists, demands-abilities and needs-suppliers. Demands-abilities is the fit in which knowledge, skills and abilities of the employee are aligned with the requirements of the job. Needs-supplies fit is when the needs, desires, or preferences of the employee are met by the job.

Needs-supplies fit can be about the individual needs and preferences, but can also include value preferences, or what type of values a person want in an organisation [@kristof2005, p. 288].

### A fit can be complementary or supplementary

A complementary fit is a fit where characteristics of the individual or the environment fills a gap for the other. For example, if the organisations lacks an accountant and an accountant joins the organisation that individual complements the environment. This examples displays a demands-abilities fits, but needs-supplies fit is complementary as well.

Supplementary fits exists when the individual and the environment are similar.
For example when the organisation already have innovative employees, but they attract another innovative employee.

### Perceived, subjective & objective fit

The research recognises three types of fit [@kristof2005, p. 291]:

- **perceived fit**; when an individual makes a direct assessment of the compatibility between person and environment
- **subjective fit**; when fit is assessed indirectly through the comparison of person and environment variables, reported by the same person
- **objective fit**; when fit is calculated indirectly through the comparison of P and E variables as reported by different sources.

These types of fit are not only measured differently, but are also likely to capture other meaning.

### Temporally separate reports to reduce common rater bias

Common rater bias describes the concern of heavy reliance on reports done by the same person. Particular in the case of reporting perceived or subjective fit and outcome variables. To overcome this common rater bias it is recommended to temporally separate the reporting of the predictor and criterion [@kristof2005, p. 291]

### Person-job fit is strongly related to job satisfaction, organisational commitment, and intent to quit

> “PJ fit has strong correlations with the three primary attitudes studied in the fit literature: .56 with job satisfaction, .47 with organisational commitment, and −.46 with intent to quit.” (Kristof-Brown et al., 2005, p. 299)
