## Summary

Team psychological safety - a shared belief held by members of a team that the team is safe for interpersonal risk taking - is positively associated with learning behaviour. As such learning behaviour mediates between team psychological safety and team performance. It provides an answer to the question how teams learn.

To understand learning behaviour in teams [[Amy Edmondson]] researched the team structures and shared beliefs jointly.

## Key ideas

### Psychological safety is a team belief

It is a shared belief held by members of a team that the team is safe for interpersonal risk taking. Members of a team with high psychological safety do not fear potential threat or embarrassment. Providing new information is used to make something better, not to mock or embarrass people.

### Learning behaviour is a process

Learning is a process which consists out of behaviour. These behaviours tries to achieve outcomes as adaptation to change, greater understand, or improved performance in teams. Argyris and Sch6n (1978) defined learning as a process of detecting and correcting error.

### Learning behaviour in teams is positively associated with team performance
