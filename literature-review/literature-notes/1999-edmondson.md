## Summary

Team psychological safety - a shared belief held by members of a team that the team is safe for interpersonal risk taking - is positively associated with learning behaviour. As such learning behaviour mediates between team psychological safety and team performance. It provides an answer to the question how teams learn.

To understand learning behaviour in teams [[Amy Edmondson]] researched the team structures and shared beliefs jointly.

## Key ideas

### Psychological safety is a team belief

It is a shared belief held by members of a team that the team is safe for interpersonal risk taking. Members of a team with high psychological safety do not fear potential threat or embarrassment. Providing new information is used to make something better, not to mock or embarrass people.

It's a belief that is tacit and not given direct attention by individuals or the team as whole.

### Learning behaviour is a process

Learning is a process which consists out of behaviour. These behaviours tries to achieve outcomes as adaptation to change, greater understanding, or improved performance in teams. Argyris and SchÃ¶n (1978) defined learning as a process of detecting and correcting error.

### Psychological safety has a positive effect on learning behaviour

The study of Edmondson found substantial empirical support for the relationship between psychological safety and learning behaviour. It effects learning behaviour which in turn affects team performance.

### Learning behaviour in teams is positively associated with team performance

Learning behaviour has shown to be a significant predictor of team performance. To engage in learning behaviour the team is highly dependent on team psychological safety.

### Learning at group level is an ongoing process

Edmondson defines learning at group level as:

> I conceptualise learning at the group level of analysis as an ongoing process of reflection and action, characterised by asking questions, seeking feedback, experimenting, reflecting on results, and discussing errors or unexpected outcomes of actions." ([Edmondson 1999:353](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GCFY8NFT?page=4))

### Mediating effect between psychological safety and team efficacy has not been found

Psychological safety is a mechanism that mediates between effective team design and learning behaviour. Having effective team leader coaching and context support help to develop an environment in which team members can develop shared beliefs foundational to psychological safety.

> Effective team leader coaching and context support, such as access to information and resources, appear to contribute to, but not to fully shape, an environment in which team members can develop shared beliefs that well-intentioned interpersonal risks will not be punished, and these beliefs enable team members to take proactive learning-oriented action, which in turn fosters effective performance." ([Edmondson 1999:377](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GCFY8NFT?page=28))

### Psychological safety is not the same as group cohesiveness

Research has shown that cohesiveness can reduce willingness to disagree and challenge others' views, such as in the phenomenon of groupthink (Janis, 1982)" ([Edmondson 1999:354](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GCFY8NFT?page=5))

### Questions to measure psychological safety

1. If you make a mistake on this team, it is often held against you.
2. Members of this team are able to bring up problems and tough issues.
3. People on this team sometimes reject others for being different.
4. It is safe to take a risk on this team.
5. It is difficult to ask other members of this team for help.
6. No one on this team would deliberately act in a way that undermines my efforts.
7. Working with members of this team,my unique skills and talents are valued and utilised.
