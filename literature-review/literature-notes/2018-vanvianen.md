## Summary

Three basic principles of person-environment fit theory are addressed in this review by [[Annelies E.M. van Vianen]]. These principles being:

- Person and environment together predict human behaviour
- Outcomes are optimal when personal and environmental attributes are comparable
- Direction of misfit between person and environment does not matter

The review provides mixed support for these explanatory factors of P-E fit. Along with the results of the review the author proposes options for future research and practice.

## Key ideas

### Three basic principles of person-environment fit

Person-Environment fit is generally defined as the compatibility between individuals and their environment. Three principles explain person-environment fit:

- Person and environment together predict human behaviour
- Outcomes are optimal when personal and environmental attributes are comparable
- Direction of misfit between person and environment does not matter

> “Fit theory is rooted in Lewin’s (1951) notion that behavior (B) is a function of the person (P) and the environment (E), expressed as B = f(P,E). Fit theory proposes that the fit between the person and the environment rather than the person and the environment separately predicts human behavior.” (Vianen, 2018, p. 82)

### People require a fit between own characteristics and environment

> “Fit theory assumes that people have an innate need to fit their environments and to seek out environments that match their own characteristics. Individuals strive to fit because they generally prefer consistency, wish to exert control over their life and to reduce uncertainty, have a need to belong, and want happiness and life satisfaction (Yu 2013).” (Vianen, 2018, p. 77)

### Fit can be supplementary or complementary

The fit literature distinguishes two forms of compatibility. Supplementary fit is concerned with similar attributes between individual and environmental. For example, individual values have to match with those of the organisation. These are typically researched in person-organisation and person-team fits.

Complementary fits are concerned about individual attributes that are complemented by the environment. For example, preferences of an individual can be complemented by an organisation. Person-job and person-vocation fits are examples of complementary fits.

### Individual appreciate fit and seek it

Fit has been found to be important for people as they prefer consistency, wish to exert control over their life and to reduce uncertainty, have a need to belong, and want happiness and life satisfaction. It allows individuals to better understand the behaviours of others and facilitate interactions between people.

Fit is associated with positive individual outcomes. It relates most strongly to attitudinal outcomes (e.g. satisfaction), and less strongly to behavioural outcomes (e.g. performance, turnover)

> “Furthermore, the strength of the fit–outcome relationship varies by fit domain. Person–job fit relates most strongly to job satisfaction, career satisfaction, and occupational commitment; person–organization fit relates most strongly to organizational commitment, organizational identification, and perceived support; person–team fit relates particularly strongly to attitudes toward peers; and person–supervisor fit relates most strongly to attitudes regarding the supervisor (Van Vianen et al. 2016).” (Vianen, 2018, p. 81)

### Optimal fit is not always possible or needed

> “In reality, however, optimal fit seldom exists, cannot be realized, and may even undermine the human capacity to learn, develop, and adapt, as discrepancies tend to motivate people to move (e.g., Bandura 1991).” (Vianen, 2018, p. 91)

In other words, a level of misfit is even required to ensure individuals learn and move into a mode of action.

### Individuals flourish when experiencing fit on the attributes they find important

Several researches has shown high outcomes when personal and environmental attributes are both high. However, high levels of fit in relation with high levels of performance have primarily been found when the attribute under study was of importance of the individual.

### Organisation should assess applicants for proactive behaviour

Individuals that respond proactively to misfits have proven to engage in proactive behaviour. Assessing applicants if they respond proactively to misfits might be beneficial in attracting and retaining a workforce able to cope with adjustments in (mis)fit levels.
