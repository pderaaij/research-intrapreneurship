## Summary

In 2017 Newman et al. performed a systematic review on the literature on psychological safety up to 2015. In this article they display they view on the state of the literature and propose future research themes.

## Key ideas

### Edmondson's definition and measurement on psychological safety is the most reliable one

> “Edmondson's (1999) measure of psychological safety has consistently been found to be reliable across diverse samples as evidenced by the fact that all of the studies that we reviewed, that used her 7-item measure, reported very good internal consistency reliability estimates.” (Newman et al., 2017, p. 4)

### Psychological safety is important in certain work environments

It has been found that psychological safety is especially important in work environments where employee and customer safety are paramount. It has shown to be critical in reducing employee errors and enhancing safety.

### Psychological safety differs from trust

Some overlap between trust and psychological safety exists, but the latter is conceptually different. Psychological safety focuses on how group members perceive a group norm, while trust focusses on how one person views another.

### Psychological safety likely has the most meaning at team level

Although research took place at individual and organisational level, the most valid research has been found at team level. Research at organisational level often results in compromised construct validation.

### Individual perception of psychological safety is influenced by leader behaviour

Leader inclusiveness, support, trustworthiness, openness, and behavioural integrity strongly influence employee perceptions of psychological safety. This results in driving employee outcomes as voice behaviours, involvement in creative work, job performance and engagement.

### Team perception on psychological safety is determined by collective perceptions

Support and coaching from the team leader, leader inclusiveness, trust in the leader, and behavioural integrity of the leader has been found to foster team-level outcomes such as team learning behaviour, team performance, engagement in quality improvement work, and reduction in errors amongst team members.

### Social relationships as drivers of psychological safety and its outcomes

The relationship that people have is proven to influence the psychological safety and as result its outcomes.

> “researchers have found that the key drivers of psychological safety and its outcomes are: the level of prior interaction between; and familiarity among, team members (Roberto, 2002); the quality of social relationships between team members as measured by trust; network ties and collective thinking (Gu, Wang, & Wang, 2013; Huang & Jiang, 2012; Schulte, Cohen, & Klein, 2012); high quality relationships between team members and external parties (Brueller & Carmeli, 2011); and membership of the inner-circle (Burris, Rodgers, Mannix, Hendron, & Oldroyd, 2009).” (Newman et al., 2017, p. 5)

### Higher levels of psychological safety for certain team characteristics

Shared team rewards, formal team structures, and team engagement in boundary work (buffering, spanning, and reinforcement) are positively associated with higher levels of team psychological safety.

> “Finally, O'Neill (2009) found that when team members were collectively responsible for bad investment decisions, psychological safety gave them the courage to admit failure, whereas when they were individually responsible, psychological safety escalated their commitment to bad investment decisions. They argued that this is due to the fact that, when there is collective responsibility, team members are less motivated to salvage a project that may fail.” (Newman et al., 2017, p. 6)

### Psychological safety has been linked to communication outcomes

Greater reporting of treatment errors and more interpersonal communication has been linked to higher levels of psychological safety. The same goes for greater knowledge sharing among team members. Additionally it has been found that among employees more voice behaviour has been shown.

### Psychological safety has negative consequences

Research has found that psychological safety could lead to more unethical behaviour.

### Psychological safety is linked to a variety of effects

Among various studies it has been found that psychological safety has a postive effect on:

- team performance (through learning behaviour)
- creative thinking and risk-taking
- innovation in R&D teams
- manufacturing process innovation improvement
- knowledge creation
- successful implementation of technology

### Environments that benefit from learning

Task environments that require higher creativity, sense-making, complexity, and social contact/impact benefit stronger from psychological safety.
